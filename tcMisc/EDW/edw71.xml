  <body>
   <p>This document outlines the strategy proposed by the TEI Editors for the
   next Revision of TEI P4, the new XML/SGML compatible version of the
   TEI Guidelines. Our guiding principle in drawing this up has
     been to avoid as far as possible any major revision of the
     content of the
     Guidelines &amp;mdash; not because we believe such revision to be
     unnecessary but because we believe it should be carried out by
     properly constituted and chartered workgroups. We believe the topics
     listed here are all necessary and  non-controversial
     modifications, motivated only by the desire to catch up on some
     of the technical and infrastructural changes in the world since
     1994. </p>
<div><head>Current state of play</head>
   <p>TEI P4 has been through a number of automatic and semi-automatic
   procedures, most of them documented in TEI ED W69, and TEI ED
   W70. At the conclusion of those processes, we have:
<list>
<item>New versions of all TEI ODD files which use XML syntax and which
   conform with an XML DTD made from the original TEI ODD dtd;</item>
      <item>XSL-T stylesheets which can be used to generate the DTD
   fragments and/or readable text in HTML or PDF from the foregoing; </item>
<item>a complete set of new TEI DTD fragments, which can be
   parameterised for use in either SGML or XML;</item>
      <item>a text of P4 in which the examples have been systematically checked
    and converted to use XML syntax, and in which all explicit references to SGML have been
    systematically reviewed and changed to reflect the new status of
    the Guidelines.</item>
</list>
    </p>
   </div>
   <div><head>Work to be done</head>
   <p>In the opinion of the editors, the following work remains to be
    done before we will have a publishable version of the P4
    Guidelines:
<list type="ordered"><item>all of the text needs to be proof-read for inadvertently
    introduced or long-lurking typos;</item>
      <item>the <soCalled>gentle guide</soCalled> to SGML needs to be
    rewritten to make clear which parts of it relate to XML and which
    to SGML;</item>
<item>the recommendations in chapters 4 and 25 about character encoding
    issues need to be completely overhauled and rethought in the light
    of Unicode;</item>
      <item>the formal grammar of SGML needs to be removed,
    or either supplemented or replaced by an equivalent formal grammar
    for XML;</item>
      <item>discussion of SDIF and other defunct standards needs to
    be replaced or removed;</item>
<item>discussion of at least some of the following is needed: XML Schema,
    Unicode, Namespaces, XPath, Xpointer, Xlink, XInclude, RDF,
    Fragment spec, MathML, Dublin Core, URLs vs. FPIs at various
    places in the text;</item>
      <item>the bibliography needs to be brought up to date.</item>
     </list></p>

    <p>Much of the above work is fairly easy and uncontentious. Other
    parts are more problematic, requiring either larger investments of
    time and effort than are readily available or requiring wider
    consultation with the TEI community. In particular, it seems to us
    that the character encoding recommendations (primarily chap 4 but
    also 25, 37) have been largely overtaken by events, and are thus
    overdue for review. We propose that a workgroup be chartered by
    the Board to address this problem as soon as possible, in advance
    of the existence of the TEI Council which should formally ratify
    its work. A separate document (TEI EDW72) proposes a charge and
    suggests an initial membership for this workgroup. The group will
    be asked to produce a preliminary report in time for the first TEI
    members meeting in mid October, by when it is hoped that a
    significant proportion of the remainder of the workplan specified
    in the next section will also be completed.

<head>Editorial work plan</head>

<p>We list below a very minimal workplan, subject to review and
     reaction from the Board and from the panel of proof readers we
     hope to recruit. 
<list>
<item>Redraft Gentle Guide to include XML: LB to do by mid-Sept</item>
<item>Introduce discussion of Xlink and related standards into chapter
       14 (linking and alignment): SDR to do by mid-Sept</item>
<item>Recruit volunteer proof readers, allocate chapters to them, act
       on their feedback: LB/SDR to complete by start October.</item>
<item>Revise bibliography: volunteer needed</item>
<item>Review  chapter 39 (formal grammar): volunteer needed</item>
<item>Review chapter 28, 29, 30
 (conformance, modification, interchange) for significant content
       changes: volunteer needed</item>
      <item>Propose new material on Dublin Core, RDF and other
       relevant metadata standards for inclusion in chapters 5 and 24 (the
       Header): volunteer needed; </item>
      <item>Propose material on MathML (and namespaces?) for chapter
       22 (Tables, formulae, and graphics): volunteer needed </item>
      <item>Revise chap 27 (Tagset doc) to include specification of
       the ODD system as used in P4 : LB to do, but not any time soon</item>
