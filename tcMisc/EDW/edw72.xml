<head>TEI Workgroup on Charset Issues : Charge</head>
<p>As a part of the immediate revision of the TEI Guidelines, the
    Board of Directors of the TEI Consortium has decided to set up a
    special workgroup on character set encoding issues. This document
    specifies the charter of that workgroup, and is formally binding
    on the work group members.
   </p>
<p>The charge to the Workgroup is as follows:
<list>
<item>to review thoroughly all aspects of the recommendations
   currently presented in TEI P4 with respect to the representation of
   character sets and writing systems;</item>
     <item>to identify recommendations which are no longer appropriate
   because they have been superceded 
   and to propose wording for alternative improved
   recommendations;</item>
     <item>to identify recommendations which might be improved upon in the
   light of the experience and judgment of the workgroup, and to
   suggest such improvements;</item>
     <item>to identify and document new proposals for substantial
   revisions to the recommendations, which may represent significant
   departure from current TEI practice but would improve TEI's
   alignment with respect to other current standards or procedures.</item>
    </list>
   </p>
<p>Specific issues to be addressed by the Workgroup include (but are
   not limited to) the proper use of Unicode, the structure and content of
   the TEI Writing System Declaration, the usability of Unicode
   private-use spaces, the LANG attribute and its relation to
   xml:lang.</p>
<p>The Workgroup should endeavour to ensure that adoption of its recommendations
   will not invalidate existing TEI documents, as far as this is
   possible, and to propose simple conversion paths where it is
   not.</p>
<p>The Workgroup's output should include specific
   recommendations for rewordings or revisions to the current text of
   TEI P4, which must be made available by the end of September
   2001. The Workgroup may also choose to propose a more detailed
   plan of subsequent work to be carried out by itself or by a
   successor group, in the form of a discussion paper or draft set of
   recommendations for debate. </p>
<p>The proposed initial membership of the workgroup is as follows:
<list>
<item>Christian Wittern, Kyoto University (wittern@kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp) : chair</item>
<item>Deborah Anderson, Berkeley (dwanders@socrates.berkeley.edu) </item>
<item>David Birnbaum, Pitssburgh University (djbpitt+@pitt.edu)</item>
<item>Patrick Durusau, Emory University (pdurusau@emory.edu) </item>
<item>Durgesh Rao, NCST Mumbai </item>
<item>Maria Gavrilidou </item>
</list>
   </p><p>The two TEI editors sit ex officio on all TEI
   workgroups. Additional members may be invited to join the group at
   the discretion of the Chair, and subject to approval by the Board. </p>

   <p>The Workgroup should conduct its business as far as possible according to the
   rules specified by TEI Document EDW 54, except where otherwise
   directed by the Board or (when it is constituted) the TEI
   Council. Because of tight time constraints, it is expected that this
   Workgroup will conduct its business almost exclusively by electronic
   means: a private mailing list and webspace will be provided for
   that purpose.  </p>
