the Task Force in the funding application are as follows: <q>[In the
task force] selected TEI experts and editors (8 people, total) work
closely with representatives from projects with significant TEI SGML
holdings (another 10 people) to diagnose and document the problems,
methods, and tools necessary to design and effect a migration from
SGML to XML, in TEI.  One start-up meeting with editors and experts
only; one mid-term meeting with project representatives; one final
meeting with editors and experts.  Participation from TEI technical
writer for four months, participation of TEI editors and executive
director for two months. Travel to two one-day meetings for 8 people,
travel to one two-day meeting for 18 people.  [Total Budget]
      $67533.33</q>

<p>The Chair may modify this workplan as necessary to meet the goals
     of the funding proposal, subject to
     approval of the TEI Council, and to the overall financial limits stated.</p>
