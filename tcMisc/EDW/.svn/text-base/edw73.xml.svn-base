   <head>Introduction</head><p>This standing document contains a
   numbered list of proposals for change in the recommendations of TEI
   P4. The list is derived from a variety of sources, chiefly, but not
   exclusively, email
   to TEI-L and comments to the editors during the production of TEI P4.</p>
    <p>This list will be kept up to date, as far as possible: new
   items will be added and the disposition of old items noted during
   the process of revising P4 towards P5. The current version of this
   document will be available from the TEI Members only site (at <xptr
   url="http://www.tei-c.org/Members/Drafts/edw73.xml"/>).</p>

The value attribute serves two distinct purposes:

1.  regularize the content of DATE into a format which can easily be
    searched, preferably one that can easily be parsed and searched.
2.  normalize the content of DATE to a date along an agreed upon
    timeline.
It makes sense that these would be two separate attributes, as one
may reasonably want different values for these purposes. For example,
we like to regularize the *format* of our Julian dates, but would
rather not be bothered trying to figure out what the Gregorian (i.e.,
normalized) value would be, mostly because it is often hard to tell.
