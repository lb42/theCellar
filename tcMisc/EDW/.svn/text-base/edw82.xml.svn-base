        <p>This work group is charged with developing guidelines for
          encoding information about the physical structure of printed
          books: specifically, information about how individual pages
          are located and identified within the larger structures of
          signatures and gatherings. The audience being served is
          fairly narrowly construed as the community of descriptive
          and analytical bibliographers for whom this information is
          essential as a way of documenting the construction of the
          physical book and as the basis for further analysis of
          printing practices and the history of particular editions.</p>
        <p>While this work group is not expected to cover issues
          specific to manuscript documents, its recommendations should
          not unnecessarily preclude their use to encode similar
          information about manuscript documents, and to this end this
          work group is expected to maintain communication with the
          Manuscript Description work group and to review the
          materials they have already produced in this area.</p>

          <item>Review notes and documents prepared by Manuscript
            Description work group concerning collation.</item>
          <item>Review the needs and practices of those parts of the
            TEI community (and relevant parts  of the potential TEI
            community: i.e. those who would use the TEI if it included
            provision for this kind of encoding) likely to use
            facilities for encoding collation and physical document
            structure.</item>
          <item>Propose a detailed work plan to improve and extend
            upon the recommendations currently provided by TEI P4 in
            these areas. The work plan will be determined by agreement
            of the working group but is expected to address at least
            the following:
            <list>
              <item>provision for encoding basic structural
                information about each page in the document (i.e. its
                identification with respect to the collation of the
                entire document), this information being associated
                directly with the individual page;</item>
              <item>provision for encoding a summary of structural
                information about the document as a whole (i.e. an
                equivalent of a collational formula, encoded in the
                TEI header);</item>
              <item>provision for several types of commentary on the
                physical document structure (e.g. information, both
                structured and unstructured, such as measurements,
                identification, and description of features of paper
                or typography; summaries of printing history;
                identification of cancels, etc.);</item>
              <item>provision for several types of derived analytical
                perspectives on the physical document structure (e.g.
                reconstructions of individual formes, bifolia, other
                higher-order structures) using stand-off markup (e.g.
                <gi>join</gi>), and provision for where this
                information should be located within the encoded
                document;</item>
              <item>in concert with the Manuscript Description
                workgroup, harmonization of treatment of collation and
                physical document structure for printed books and
                manuscripts, at least to ensure that no redundant or
                incompatible recommendations are made in either
                section of the Guidelines.</item>

        <p>The chair of the work group is Terry Catapano. The TEI
          Editors are ex officio members of all TEI Work Groups. Other
          constraints and procedures applicable to all TEI work groups
          are described in document <xref
            url="../Vault/ED/edw54.tei">TEI EDW54</xref>. The group
          has a budget of USD 250 for the year ending 2004, during
          which no meetings are authorized, but conference calls are
          expected to take place.</p>
        <p>The work group is required to provide progress reports on
          its work regularly to the TEI Technical Council, which has
          authority for approving all technical output from the work
          group.</p>
        <p>The work group will meet regularly by conference call, and
          will communicate by <xref
        url="http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/tei-pb.html">mailing list</xref>.</p>
