<h2>
<a name="body.1_div.1"></a>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<a name="id2624822"></a>Review the status of current TEI Recommendations for handling
      stand-off or out-of-line markup. </li>
<li>
<a name="id2624828"></a>Review the TEI extended
     pointer syntax with respect to current needs and practices.</li>
<li>
<a name="id2624835"></a>Review the TEI linking and hypertext recommendations with
respect to current needs and practices.</li>
<li>
<a name="id2624841"></a>Review the needs and practices of those parts of the TEI user
      community likely to use such facilities. In particular, the
      needs and practices of the following communities should be considered:
<ul>
<li>
<a name="id2624851"></a>applied linguists representing multiple levels or layers of
	analysis of a corpus; </li>
<li>
<a name="id2624857"></a>social scientists, historians, descriptive linguists and
	others creating and archiving
	multimodal resources (oral history, video, transcripts, etc.) </li>
<li>
<a name="id2624865"></a>applied linguists attempting integrated analyses of multimodal
	communication (involving speech, writing, gesture, movement etc.)</li>
<li>
<a name="id2624872"></a>philologists and interpretive critics recording multiple
	interpretations  of a single written text;</li>
<li>
<a name="id2624879"></a>translators and others working with multilingual corpora;</li>
<li>
<a name="id2624884"></a>authors and encoders of documents that include cross-references, indexes,
and other hypertextual features;</li>
<li>
<a name="id2624891"></a>encoders who need to represent existing hypertext documents in
TEI format.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name="id2624898"></a>Review the facilities provided in this area by standards
      which have appeared since the publication of P4, in particular
      applications based on the W3C Xlink and Xpointer standards, such as : <ul>
<li>
<a name="id2624908"></a>ISLE</li>
<li>
<a name="id2624912"></a>MATE</li>
<li>
<a name="id2624916"></a>Annotation Graphs</li>
<li>
<a name="id2624921"></a>Talkbank</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name="id2624926"></a>Propose a detailed work plan (possibly involving further work
	groups), to improve and extend upon the Recommendations provided
    by TEI P4 in these areas.  The work plan will be determined
by agreement of the working group but is expected to address at least
	the following:
<ul>
<li>
<a name="id2624938"></a>convergence of the TEI Extended Pointer Syntax with current and
	forthcoming W3C recommendations for XLink;</li>
<li>
<a name="id2625095"></a>case-studies and best practice recommendations for use of TEI
	linkage and alignment procedures in the domains mentioned above;</li>
<li>
<a name="id2625101"></a>definition of cross-walk mappings, as needed, amongst other current
	standards in this area, using TEI as an inter-language</li>
<li>
<a name="id2625107"></a>development of example code that performs appropriate TEI
processing for the adjusted recommendations. This could include
development of XSLT stylesheets, or the adaptation of other already existing
tools, as determined by the working group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a name="id2625116"></a>Respond to comments on the relevant portions of TEI P4
    routed to this work group by the editors.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a name="id2625128"></a>
The head of the work group is David Durand, who should propose an
     initial membership as soon as possible, for ratification by the
     TEI Board at its next meeting. The TEI Editors are ex officio
     members of all TEI Work Groups. Other constraints and procedures
     applicable to all TEI Work Groups are described in document TEI
     ED W54. </p>
<p>
<a name="id2625138"></a>The group has a budget of USD 8000 for the year ending 2003, during
     which one meeting is authorized. </p>
<p>
<a name="id2625143"></a>The Work group is required to provide  progress reports on its work regularly
to the TEI Technical Council, which has authority for approving
all technical output from the work group. </p>
<p>
<a name="id2625150"></a>The work group will meet regularly by conference call, and will communicate
by mailing list. Part of the initial decision-making on the work plan will be
a choice between two forms of face-to-face meeting; either as a kick-off to
the work of the group, or as working meeting to make progress on difficult
technical issues once the group is underway.</p>
