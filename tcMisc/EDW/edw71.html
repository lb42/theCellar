               <p><a name="d17e56"></a>This document outlines the strategy proposed by the TEI Editors for the
                  next Revision of TEI P4, the new XML/SGML compatible version of the
                  TEI Guidelines. Our guiding principle in drawing this up has
                  been to avoid as far as possible any major revision of the
                  content of the
                  Guidelines &#8212; not because we believe such revision to be
                  unnecessary but because we believe it should be carried out by
                  properly constituted and chartered workgroups. We believe the topics
                  listed here are all necessary and  non-controversial
                  modifications, motivated only by the desire to catch up on some
                       of the technical and infrastructural changes in the world since
                       1994.

                  <p><a name="d17e63"></a>TEI P4 has been through a number of automatic and semi-automatic
                        procedures, most of them documented in TEI ED W69, and TEI ED
                        W70. At the conclusion of those processes, we have:
                     
                     <ul>
                        <li><a name="d17e67"></a>New versions of all TEI ODD files which use XML syntax and which
                              conform with an XML DTD made from the original TEI ODD dtd;
                        </li>
                        <li><a name="d17e70"></a>XSL-T stylesheets which can be used to generate the DTD
                              fragments and/or readable text in HTML or PDF from the foregoing; 
                        </li>
                        <li><a name="d17e73"></a>a complete set of new TEI DTD fragments, which can be
                              parameterised for use in either SGML or XML;
                        </li>
                        <li><a name="d17e76"></a>a text of P4 in which the examples have been systematically checked
                               and converted to use XML syntax, and in which all explicit references to SGML have been
                               systematically reviewed and changed to reflect the new status of
                               the Guidelines.

                  <p><a name="d17e86"></a>In the opinion of the editors, the following work remains to be
                         done before we will have a publishable version of the P4
                         Guidelines:
                     
                     <ol>

                        <li><a name="d17e92"></a>the `gentle guide' to SGML needs to be
                               rewritten to make clear which parts of it relate to XML and which
                               to SGML;
                        </li>
                        <li><a name="d17e98"></a>the recommendations in chapters 4 and 25 about character encoding
                               issues need to be completely overhauled and rethought in the light
                               of Unicode;
                        </li>
                        <li><a name="d17e101"></a>the formal grammar of SGML needs to be removed,
                               or either supplemented or replaced by an equivalent formal grammar
                               for XML;
                        </li>

                               be replaced or removed;

                        <li><a name="d17e107"></a>discussion of at least some of the following is needed: XML Schema,
                               Unicode, Namespaces, XPath, Xpointer, Xlink, XInclude, RDF,
                               Fragment spec, MathML, Dublin Core, URLs vs. FPIs at various
                               places in the text;
                        </li>
                        <li><a name="d17e110"></a>the bibliography needs to be brought up to date.

                  </p>
                  
                      
                  <p><a name="d17e114"></a>Much of the above work is fairly easy and uncontentious. Other
                         parts are more problematic, requiring either larger investments of
                         time and effort than are readily available or requiring wider
                         consultation with the TEI community. In particular, it seems to us
                         that the character encoding recommendations (primarily chap 4 but
                         also 25, 37) have been largely overtaken by events, and are thus
                         overdue for review. We propose that a workgroup be chartered by
                         the Board to address this problem as soon as possible, in advance
                         of the existence of the TEI Council which should formally ratify
                         its work. A separate document (TEI EDW72) proposes a charge and
                         suggests an initial membership for this workgroup. The group will
                         be asked to produce a preliminary report in time for the first TEI
                         members meeting in mid October, by when it is hoped that a
                         significant proportion of the remainder of the workplan specified
                         in the next section will also be completed.
