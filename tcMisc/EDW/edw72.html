               TEI Workgroup on Charset Issues : Charge
               
               <p><a name="d17e55"></a>As a part of the immediate revision of the TEI Guidelines, the
                  Board of Directors of the TEI Consortium has decided to set up a
                  special workgroup on character set encoding issues. This document
                      specifies the charter of that workgroup, and is formally binding
                      on the work group members.
                     
               </p>
               
               <p><a name="d17e58"></a>The charge to the Workgroup is as follows:
                  
                  <ul>
                     <li><a name="d17e62"></a>to review thoroughly all aspects of the recommendations
                           currently presented in TEI P4 with respect to the representation of
                           character sets and writing systems;
                     </li>
                     <li><a name="d17e65"></a>to identify recommendations which are no longer appropriate
                           because they have been superceded 
                           and to propose wording for alternative improved
                           recommendations;
                     </li>
                     <li><a name="d17e68"></a>to identify recommendations which might be improved upon in the
                           light of the experience and judgment of the workgroup, and to
                           suggest such improvements;
                     </li>
                     <li><a name="d17e71"></a>to identify and document new proposals for substantial
                           revisions to the recommendations, which may represent significant
                           departure from current TEI practice but would improve TEI's
                           alignment with respect to other current standards or procedures.
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                     
               </p>
               
               <p><a name="d17e76"></a>Specific issues to be addressed by the Workgroup include (but are
                     not limited to) the proper use of Unicode, the structure and content of
                     the TEI Writing System Declaration, the usability of Unicode
                     private-use spaces, the LANG attribute and its relation to
                     xml:lang.
               </p>
               
               <p><a name="d17e79"></a>The Workgroup should endeavour to ensure that adoption of its recommendations
                     will not invalidate existing TEI documents, as far as this is
                     possible, and to propose simple conversion paths where it is
                     not.
               </p>
               
               <p><a name="d17e82"></a>The Workgroup's output should include specific
                     recommendations for rewordings or revisions to the current text of
                     TEI P4, which must be made available by the end of September
                     2001. The Workgroup may also choose to propose a more detailed
                     plan of subsequent work to be carried out by itself or by a
                     successor group, in the form of a discussion paper or draft set of
                     recommendations for debate. 
               </p>
               
               <p><a name="d17e85"></a>The proposed initial membership of the workgroup is as follows:
                  
                  <ul>
                     <li><a name="d17e89"></a>Christian Wittern, Kyoto University (wittern@kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp) : chair
                     </li>
                     <li><a name="d17e92"></a>Deborah Anderson, Berkeley (dwanders@socrates.berkeley.edu) 
                     </li>
                     <li><a name="d17e95"></a>David Birnbaum, Pitssburgh University (djbpitt+@pitt.edu)
                     </li>
                     <li><a name="d17e98"></a>Patrick Durusau, Emory University (pdurusau@emory.edu) 
                     </li>
                     <li><a name="d17e101"></a>Durgesh Rao, NCST Mumbai 
                     </li>
                     <li><a name="d17e104"></a>Maria Gavrilidou 
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                     
               </p>
               <p><a name="d17e108"></a>The two TEI editors sit ex officio on all TEI
                     workgroups. Additional members may be invited to join the group at
                     the discretion of the Chair, and subject to approval by the Board. 
               </p>
               
                  
               <p><a name="d17e111"></a>The Workgroup should conduct its business as far as possible according to the
                     rules specified by TEI Document EDW 54, except where otherwise
                     directed by the Board or (when it is constituted) the TEI
                     Council. Because of tight time constraints, it is expected that this
                     Workgroup will conduct its business almost exclusively by electronic
                     means: a private mailing list and webspace will be provided for
                     that purpose.  
               </p>
