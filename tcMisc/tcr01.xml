	  <head>Character Encoding Workgroup</head>
	  <byline>Chaired by Christian Wittern, charged July 2001</byline>
	  <p>This workgroup was charged by the TEI Council to
revise those areas of the TEI Guidelines that deal with representation
of characters, languages and writing systems, which includes the current
Chapter 4 (Languages and Character Sets) and Chapter 25 (Writing
System Declaration).</p>
	  <p>Since its inception in the Summer of 2001, the Character
Encoding Workgroup has met twice face to face, in October 2001 in
Berkeley and in July 2002 in Tübingen. Over this past year, the
business has been conducted by email, but another face to face meeting
is planned immediately prior to the Members Meeting in Nancy, November
2003.  All draft documents of the workgroup are available from the
workgroup area on the TEI homepage (<xptr url="../Activities/CE"/>).</p>
	  <p>The workgroup has spent most of its effort this past year
in drafting and revising an introduction to character set issues,
Unicode and its implication for XML processing. This is available as
document CEW01 at the website and was presented to the TEI Council in
May. At that
time the Council requested some minor changes, which are
currently being worked on.</p>
	  <p>Another area of work has been to develop markup
constructs to augment, modify or replace the orthodox Unicode
interpretation of characters in specific contexts, as well as to
provide for the extension of the character set available to text
encoders.  This work is reported in working paper CEW06
<title>Representation of non-standard characters and glyphs</title>
which was also discussed by the TEI
Council. Its underlying model was found to be sound, but considerable
revision is required, especially to bring it in line with the recent
developments towards P5.  </p>
	  <p>The workgroup also tried to collect some use cases of
these mechanisms in different languages and encoding scenarios and
some members worked on testing the markup constructs in real life
projects.  The current draft was also presented and discussed with
fruitful results at a Conference on Character Encoding issues at
Academia Sinica, Taipei in March 2003.</p>
	  <p>The workgroup plans to wrap up the open issues and submit
a final report to the TEI Council at the next council meeting.</p>

	  <head>Stand-Off Markup Workgroup</head>
	  <byline>Chaired by David Durand, charged May 2002</byline>
	  <p>
The Workgroup on Stand-Off markup and Linking has been working on 
several working-group documents, discussing linking strategy, 
linguistic annotations, the TEI canonical reference system, and a 
summary of the rationale for the larger decisions taken in this 
process. Progress has been slow, but is ongoing. Some portions of the 
work have been presented to the council for feedback, while others 
are still in preparation. We project that the working papers will be 
submitted to the TEI council at the next council meeting, for 
approval. Any feedback on the work so far is welcomed.

</p>
	  <p>Another activity of the group has been the development of
	  some sample software tools that may prove helpful to
	  projects engaging with the changes in pointing
	  mechanisms. This effort has produced two sample
	  implementations: A Perl script that can translate old-format
	  TEI Extended Pointers in TEI documents into the W3C XPointer
	  syntax, recommended by the workgroup, and an implementation
	  of the W3C XPointer language.
<list>
	      <head>Working documents updated since last year include:
</head>
<item>TEI SOW2 technical rationale: An explanation of the rationale for the 
major changes introduced by this workgroup.

</item>
	      <item>TEI SOW4 Notes on Media formats and XPointer: This document discusses 
the linking of images and image metadata to TEI documents. The 
biggest change here is the use of the SVG (Structured Vector 
Graphics) DTD to tag included images.

</item>
	      <item>TEI SOW5 Corpus applications: This document describes Corpus and 
other linguistic applications of Standoff markup and annotation

</item>
	      <item>TEI SOW6 Standoff Markup: discusses the use of the W3C XInclude 
standard to represent standoff markup documents. Revisions are under 
discussion on the group mailing list.

</item>
	      <item>TEI SOW7: Notes on the representation of graph structures in the TEI; 
generated as advice to any other workgroup that may deal with these 
phenomena. Accepted by Council/finished.

</item>
	      <item>TEI SOW8: The document is a replacement for the current "canonical 
reference" scheme in the TEI, and has been accepted by the TEI 
Council.


</item>
	      <item>SOW2, 4, and 5 have received most recent attention.

</item>
	      <item>SOW3 (revised chapters) is delayed, awaiting the completion of the 
other documents.
</item>
	    </list>
</p>
	  <p>Progress on this workgroup has been slow, and there remain many 
things yet to do. The work is carried on by email list and conference 
call. Energetic volunteers are encouraged to contact the chair if 
they want to participate.

	  <head>SGML/XML Conversion Workgroup</head>
	  <byline>Chaired by Christine Ruotolo, charged May 2002</byline>

<p>The TEI Task Force on SGML to XML Migration was convened in May
2002 and <xref url="../Drafts/edw76.html">charged</xref> with
developing recommendations for migrating existing TEI resources from
SGML to XML.  The Task Force comprises representatives from projects
with significant TEI SGML investment, along with selected technical
experts and the TEI editors, and has worked for the past 18 months to
diagnose and document the problems, methods, and tools necessary to
migrate legacy TEI data to XML.</p>

<p>The members of the Task Force met three times over the past year: in
October 2002 in Chicago (immediately following TEI Annual Members
Meeting), in February 2003 at the University of Maryland, and in June 2003
at the University of Alicante.  Minutes from each of the meetings are
available from the Task Force <xref
url="../Activities/MI/">activities page</xref>, as is a
detailed <xref
url="../Activities/MI/miw05.html">workplan</xref>
written after the first meeting.</p>

<p>The primary deliverables of the Task Force are two reports, <xref
url="../Activities/MI/miw02.html">Strategic
Considerations in Migration of TEI Documents from SGML to XML</xref> and
the <xref url="../Activities/MI/miw03.html">Practical
Guide to Migration of TEI Documents from SGML to XML</xref>.  The first
report, intended for administrators and project managers, emphasizes the
planning and decision-making involved in data migration, while the second
report describes the mechanics of conversion in greater detail and is
written primarily for the technical staff who will implement the
conversion.  The specific recommendations in the technical report are
augmented by a set of Migration Case Study Reports (MIW06a-j) that discuss
individual migration efforts undertaken by members of the Task Force.</p>

<p>As of October 2003, the reports and case studies have been thoroughly
reviewed by the Task Force members and edited by a technical writer.  The
final drafts will be circulated back to the group for a brief review
period before being forwarded on to the TEI Council for comment.   The
reports and case studies will be officially presented to the greater TEI
community at the Annual Members Meeting in Nancy (November 2003). </p>

	  <head>Manuscript Description Task-force</head>
	  <byline>Chaired by Matthew Driscoll, charged February 2003</byline>
<p>
The work of the Manuscript Description Task-force, which has as its
goal the reconciliation or merging of the various schemes for encoding
manuscript descriptions using TEI-conformant XML (principally MASTER
and the TEI-MMSS workgroup, but also the scheme devised for the Sofia
based Repertorium of Old Bulgarian Literature), proceeds apace.  The
members of the task force, Messrs. Bauman, Birnbaum, Burnard, Driscoll
(chair) and Ms. Proffitt, met in Reykjavík, Iceland, from Sunday 7 to
Tuesday 9 September 2003. Minutes of the meeting may be viewed at
<xptr url="../Activities/MS/msm01.html"/>

</p>
	  <p>In particular we were keen to provide a mechanism for those wishing to encode legacy data in as simple a way as possible, i.e. without requiring extensive re-writing or re-ordering of the data by the encoder (what could be called the TEI-MMSS approach), while at the same time allowing those wishing to produce highly-structured detailed descriptions, possibly but not necessarily on the basis of existing data (the MASTER approach) to do so. An idea put forward at the TEI council meeting in Oxford, viz. that this might best be accomplished by defining separate elements, one for structured and the other for unstructured descriptions, on the analogy of the existing <gi>biblStruct</gi> and <gi>bibl</gi>, was rejected, as the difference between two approaches are more a matter of degree than nature, and a transition from one view to the other should be possible without requiring re-encoding. It was also recognised that the recommendations of the two groups (MASTER and TEI-MMSS) had more in common than not, but that some of the ideas underlying them both (and to an extent also the Repertorium scheme) were in need of revision.  It was decided therefore to take as little as possible for granted, but rather to review the entire system, element for element. The result of this review is a greatly improved tagset, much more balanced and robust than either of its predecessors.  Work will be concentrated now on the production of a reference manual and a tutorial guide.	</p></div>
	<div>
	  <head>Metalanguage Workgroup</head>
	  <byline>Chaired by Sebastian Rahtz, charged March 2003</byline>

<p>This report should be read in conjunction with the other
reports at <xptr url="../Activities/META/"/>. </p>

<p>The full task force has not yet met face to face, operating only by
email, but there have been two fruitful full-day meetings in October 2003 between Lou Burnard,
Sebastian Rahtz, and Norm Walsh, and Lou Burnard,
Sebastian Rahtz, and Laurent Romary. These resulted in documents 
<xref url="../Activities/META/mew02.html">MEW 02</xref>,
<xref url="../Activities/META/mew03.html">MEW 03</xref>,
<xref url="../Activities/META/mew04.html">MEW 04</xref> and
<xref url="../Activities/META/mew05.html">MEW 05</xref>. Attention is drawn to the
analysis in <xref url="../Activities/META/mew02.html">MEW 02</xref> of the relationship
between TEI and Docbook element classes, as this may prove a fertile
area of future collaboration. The discussion recorded
<xref url="../Activities/META/mew02.html">MEW 05</xref> about linking TEI names to
corresponding concepts in a proposed ISO data category repository is also a very important development for
the future.</p>

<p>The timetable of work under the META umbrella is expected to be
as follows:
<list type="ordered">
<item>November 2003: release stable alpha version of P5 schemas
and Guidelines (in HTML) for comment by members</item>
<item>November 2003: first draft of new TEI module for tag
documentation</item>
<item>December 2003: freeze new ODD format, and hand over
P5 sources in this form to TEI editors</item>
<item>January 2004: alpha release of Pizza Chef replacement for ad hoc
generation of schemas</item>
<item>February 2004: first release of P5 with new/revised modules for
manuscript descriptions, feature structures, characters, and linking.</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>The remaining sections in this report describe the
progress on the task force's jobs of:
<list type="ordered">
<item>Revision of the ODD format to be entirely
independent of the SGML/XML notation for DTDs</item>
<item>Combination of the ODD format and the current TEI  DTD for tag documentation
(TSD) into a single standard TEI tagset.</item>
<item>Basing the new notation on one of the XML schema languages.</item>
<item>Creation of additional processors to make not
only XML DTDs (and possibly SGML as well), but also at least
one XML schema format.</item>
<item>Conversion of data types should be converted to use the
datatype library of the W3C.</item>
<item>Rewriting the Pizza Chef to allow user choice
of DTD or schema output.</item>
     </list>
The final result will be a new version of the TEI Guidelines.</p>

<div>
<head>Revision of ODD format</head>
<p>The markup used to create the TEI Guidelines, from which both
documentation and DTDs/Schemas are derived, has been reviewed
several times, and three important sets of changes have been made:
<list type="ordered">
<item>Elements which have content of literal SGML/XML code have been
converted either to have neutral TEI markup</item>
<item>Element names have been changed to make them more independent of
SGML DTD naming, and to make them more consistent with the rest of the
TEI. The main reference documentation for element classes, elements,
and patterns (entities) has been simplified</item>
<item>Element content models have been converted to use Relax NG
syntax</item>
</list>
This process should now be complete. The next stage will be to release
sample subsets of the TEI source for comment by other working groups
(eg manuscripts, feature structures, and standoff markup), to check
that they are useable for future editing.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>New module for tag documentation</head>
<p>The revision of the TSD tagset, to turn it into a proper
TEI module and to make it conform to the current Guidelines source, 
has not yet been started. It is planned to complete this during
November 2003.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Schema language</head>
<p>The Guidelines have been converted to express element syntactic
constraints using Relax NG. This work is complete, and awaiting
more user testing. The Relax NG compact syntax is used for display in
the HTML version of the Guidelines.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Processors to generate schemas</head>
<p>Tools to generate RelaxNG schemas and DTDs from the new Guidelines 
have been completed, written as XSLT transforms. The results await
user testing.</p>
<p>A tool to generated W3C Schemas from the Guidelines has not been 
written. It is intended to produce them using James Clark's
<emph>trang</emph> program from the RelaxNG schemas, on demand.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Datatypes</head>
<p>As described in the <xref url="../Activities/META/mew01.html">May report</xref>,
23 datatypes (linked to W3C datatypes where relevant) have been
defined, and linked to all the simple attribute cases. Work has not
yet started on looking at element content models to see where they
would benefit from datatyping.</p>
</div>

<div>
<head>Pizza chef rewrite</head>
<p>A prototype processor to replace the pizza chef, called
<emph>roma</emph> was developed to demonstrate at XML Europe 2003;
it works by offering a fixed set of choices (including exotica like
using MathML as the content for <gi>formula</gi>), but has not yet
been revised to work with the latest revision of P5. Work will start
on this in January 2004.</p>
</div>
	</div>

<div><head>Joint ISO/TEI Activity on Feature Structures</head>
<byline>Chaired by Kyong Lee: chartered January 2003</byline>
<p>TEI and ISO TC37/SC4 are jointly sponsoring an activity which will
result in adoption of a version of the TEI proposals for encoding
linguistic annotations using the feature structure formalism. The
group was chartered by the TEI Council in January 2003 (<xptr
url="tcw01.html"/>) and is chaired by Kyong Lee, with TEI input coming
from Laurent Romary. A draft for the standard was circulated in the
summer, and there are a number of comments which will be integrated
and discussed at a face to face meeting to be held in Nancy immediately
before the Members Meeting. A further meeting is planned for next
spring.</p>

<div><head>Training activities directed by the TEI Council</head>
<div><head>TEI Training
Session at MM02: Encoding Literary and Cultural Documents in TEI</head>
<p>
The TEI annual members'  meeting in 2002, held in Chicago, Illinois,
was accompanied by a one-day training workshop entitled "TEI Training
Session: Encoding Literary and Cultural Documents in TEI".
</p><p>
This training session used a case study model to provide advice and
discussion on specific topics in text encoding, based on real-world
problems supplied by the participants. The session was aimed at those
responsible for designing their project's encoding system. It
provided an opportunity to take a focused look at a particular
problem or set of problems, in a group of knowledgeable peers guided
by TEI experts. Participants were expected to have some basic
familiarity with the TEI. The session focused on the encoding of
literary and cultural documents, interpreted broadly.
</p><p>
The session was held from 1 to 6 pm on Thursday, October 10. Each
participant was asked to bring a problem or encoding challenge from
their own project. The session began with a general discussion of the
topics raised, followed by focused attention to each particular case
in turn. The instructors addressed each participant's questions in
depth and also drew comparisons among the projects represented. The
goal of the session was not only to answer the participants' specific
questions, but also to place them in the context of issues such as
retrieval, data interchange, and long-term project goals.
</p><p>
There were 16 participants in the workshop, and three instructors
(Julia Flanders, Syd Bauman, and Terry Catapano).
</p><p>
The feedback was positive (I am ashamed to say that I can't find the
actual responses, so I can't give quotes); people liked the
discussion format and the opportunity to address specific encoding
questions from their own projects, and they found the perspective on
other projects helpful as well. We allowed a few beginners to attend
at their request, and they found the session moved too quickly and
didn't provide enough background (which was to be expected, but
suggests that either clarifying this point or making sure to offer
introductory training as well would be desirable when possible).
</p>

</div>
<div><head>TEI Training at ACH/ALLC 2003</head>
<p>
Amit Kumar and Susan Schreibman of Maryland Institute for Technology in the
Humanities (MITH) offered two one-day TEI training workshops in conjunction
with the 2003 ACH/ALLC Annual Conference in Athens Georgia on 28-29 May.

</p><p>

On 28 May an Introduction to TEI and XML workshop was taken by eight
students. The workshop consisted of lectures and exercises that introduced
students to basic XML and TEI concepts, the TEILite DTD, constructing a TEI
Header, and how to use CSS with TEI. Comments were positive: "Thanks for an
excellent workshop &amp; plain, down-to-earth explanations/comments"; "this was
[an] excellent workshop. I really appreciate about everything (except that
the length was too short)".
</p>

<p>
On 29 May, and Introduction to XSLT workshop was taken by fourteen students.
Again, the format was lectures punctuated by exercises. All the exercises
transformed documents encoded in TEI. Students were introduced to XSLT and
XPath expressions, XSL templates, node trees, and element/attribute
matching, as well as XSLT processing models. Students were generally
satisfied with the workshop and comments were positive: "Nice format,
excellent instructors, very personable, friendly, receptive"; "there were
some typos &amp; the like in some of the handouts, but all the same, one could
generally find them &amp; work them through. Well-selected &amp; organized
materials - an excellent preparation job!"
</p>

</div>
<div>
<head>Report on Rhodes University Workshop</head>

<p>From 8th to 12th September 2003, sixteen delegates from all over
South Africa took part in the five-day workshop ‘Book &amp; Text
Studies: Humanities Computing’ at Rhodes University (Grahamstown,
South Africa). The workshop was funded by the <emph>Association for
Literary and Linguistic Computing</emph> (ALLC), certified by the TEI,
and sponsored by <emph>The Department of Computer Science and the
Department of English at Rhodes University</emph> (SA), <emph>The
School of Library, Archive, and Information Studies at University
College London</emph> (UK), and <emph>The Centre for Scholarly Editing
and Document Studies of the Royal Academy of Dutch Language and
Literature</emph> (Belgium). The latter two institutions allowed
<emph>gratis</emph> the services of the lecturers Melissa Terras and
Edward Vanhoutte &amp; Ron Van den Branden, respectively.
</p>

<p>	
The five-day workshop provided introductory training in the theory and
practice of digitizing text and images for those working in book and
text studies. Training in these skills for those working in the
Humanities is not readily available in South Africa, but both
academics and advanced students are increasingly aware of the need to
bring their work into line with that of colleagues elsewhere
implementing more advanced technologies. Course participants came from
institutions as diverse as the National English Literary Museum,
Rhodes University, The University of Zululand, The University of
Witwatersrand, The National Archives of South Africa, etc.  showing
the interest in learning the appropriate standards and technologies
relevant to their collections.
</p>

<p>	
The five workshop days each consisted of two morning sessions
(8:30-10:00 &amp; 10:30-12:00) and two afternoon sessions (1:30-3:00
&amp; 3:30-5:00) of 90 minutes each. After the first session which
introduced the workshop, Humanities Computing as a discipline, the
associations, journals, mailing-lists, publications, and institutions
involved, Edward Vanhoutte taught five (hands-on) sessions on XML and
TEI, followed by four (hands-on) sessions on XSL taught by Ron Van den
Branden, and four (hands-on) sessions on digitizing images and textual
resources taught by Melissa Terras. The workshop concluded with two
sessions on project management taught by Melissa Terras and Edward
Vanhoutte. On the evening of the first day, the Terry Sander’s
documentary film <emph>Into the Future, On the Preservation of
Knowledge in the Electronic Age</emph> was shown. The course
culminated with a course dinner, which cemented friendships made on
the course: an additional positive outcome of such a workshop being
the contacts made between the various institutions and interested
parties taking part, who were unaware of each others existence prior
to the workshop.
</p>

<p>	
All participants were provided with printouts of the lectures and a
copy of the CD-ROM <emph>XML, XSL &amp; Digitisation. Tools and
Resources</emph>, compiled by the instructors for this workshop and
sponsored by the <emph> Centre for Scholarly Editing and Document
Studies</emph>.
</p>

<p>Judging from the constant interaction with the participants during
the workshop, their comments afterwards, and the many letters of
thanks and support the local organiser, Professor John Gouws received,
the instructors feel that this was a very successful workshop which
filled an urgent need in Africa.

	  <p>I have been a TEI Council member since November 2001. In that capacity
I attended three telephone conferences and one two day meeting in
Oxford.

</p>
	  <p>In the preparation for release of TEI P4 I have read and commented on
the P3 chapter on Simple Analytic Mechanisms. I translated into
Slovene and circulated the Press Release for TEI P4.

</p>
	  <p>I am a member of the TEI/NEH Workgroup on SGML to XML Migration, where
I contributed a sample P3 to P4 migration of the multilingual
annotated MULTEXT-East corpus. I am also a member of the ISO/TEI
Workgroup on Feature Structures, where I have so far commented on the
preliminary draft of ISO TC 37/SC 4 N033 Language Resource Management
- Feature Structures. For the Nancy members meeting I have proposed a
TEI SIG on Language Technologies.

</p>
	  <p>In connection with TEI training, I have given a course on "Annotation
of Language Resources" at the 14th European Summer School in Logic,
Language and Information (ESSLLI'02), Trento, August 5-9, 2002.

</p>
	  <p>In my own work, I have in the last two years used TEI to encode
various resources. Some of these projects are now completed, some are
on-going, and most had their results presented at conferences and in
journal papers: the IJS-ELAN Slovene-English linguistically annotated
parallel corpus; the ontology-annotated GENIA corpus of MEDLINE
abstracts; the MULTEXT multilingual morphosyntactic specifications;
the Slovene Dependency Treebank; a Japanese-Slovene learners'
dictionary; and eSlomsek, a text-critical edition of 19th century
sermons by St Slom&#353;ek.
