	<head>Report of the TEI Council to the Members Meeting 2004</head>
	<p>The TEI Council is in charge of overseeing the technical
	development of the TEI Guidelines.  This year, all energy was
	devoted to develop <xref url="/P5/">P5</xref>, the next major revision of the
	Guidelines.  The development takes place mainly in the
	workgroups charged by the Council and through the work of the
	TEI editors. The Council held one face to face meeting and
	five telephone conference calls to discuss reports from
	workgroups and plan for further development.  In addition, to
	further public visibility and to be able to serve the needs of
	the members more directly, an open workspace was created at
	sourceforge.net where TEI users are able to submit and discuss
	proposals for new features of the Guidelines.  A more detailed
	report on the work of the working groups and task forces
	active during the past year follows.</p>
	<div>
	  <head>Character Encoding Workgroup</head>
	  <byline>Chaired by Christian Wittern, charged July 2001</byline>
	  <p>This workgroup was charged by the TEI Council to
revise those areas of the TEI Guidelines that deal with representation
of characters, languages and writing systems, which includes the current
Chapter 4 (Languages and Character Sets) and Chapter 25 (Writing
System Declaration).</p>
	  <p>The last meeting of this workgroup was held immediately
	  prior to the Members Meeting in Nancy, November 2003.  Some
	  of the more important outcomes of this meeting include the
	  decision to recommend to the Council that language
	  identification in TEI documents should follow other XML
	  vocabularies and use the xml:lang attribute as outlined in
	  the XML recommendation.  While there was some discussion
	  afterwards and concerns were raised by members who had not
	  been present in Nancy, the decision was not reversed and later
	  endorsed by the Council.  The workgroup submitted two draft
	  documents to the Council for discussion at its meeting in
	  Ghent. All draft documents of the workgroup are available
	  from the workgroup area on the TEI web site
	  (<xptr url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/CE"/>).</p>

	  <p>Aspects of the workgroup's current proposal were presented at the
	  ACH/ALLC conference in Goteborg by Syd Bauman.</p>
	</div>
	<div>

	  <head>Stand-Off Markup Workgroup</head>
	  <byline>Chaired by David Durand, charged May 2002</byline>
	  <p>
The Workgroup on Stand-Off markup and Linking has been working on 
several working-group documents, discussing linking strategy, 
linguistic annotations, the TEI canonical reference system, and a 
summary of the rationale for the larger decisions taken in this 
process. Progress has been slow, but is ongoing. Some portions of the 
work have been presented to the council for feedback, while others 
are still in preparation.  Any feedback on the work so far is welcomed.

</p>
	  <p>Another activity of the group has been the development of some sample 
software tools that may prove helpful to projects engaging with the 
changes in pointing mechanisms. This effort has produced two sample 
implementations: a Perl script that can translate old-format TEI 
Extended Pointers in TEI documents into the W3C XPointer syntax, 
recommended by the workgroup, and an implementation of the W3C 
XPointer language.
<list>
	      <head>Working documents updated since last year include:
</head>
<item><xref url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/SO/sow09.html">TEI
SOW09</xref> Basic working decisions on pointing and
linking. Discusses and presents some of  the 
major changes proposed by this workgroup.
</item>
	      <item> SOW3 (last updated Oct. 2004) is a preliminary revision of chapter
	      14 of the Guidelines, "Linking, Segmentation and
	      Alignment" <!-- (currently only available in  <xref
	      url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/SO/sow03.odd">ODD
	      source</xref> is available.--> not yet integrated into P5.
</item>
<item>><xref url="../Activities/SO/sow08.html">TEI SO W 08</xref>
   on   <title>Canonical References</title> has also been revamped,
      with more updates expected..</item>


<item>The changes proposed by this workgroup are likely to impact
almost every other chapter in TEI P5. Some work has begun on
considering the changes that will need to be made elsewhere, in
particular to the discussion of  simple
 pointers and linking in the core chapters. </item>

	    </list>
</p>
	  <p>Progress on this workgroup has been slow, and there remain many 
things yet to do. The work is carried on by email list and conference 
call. Energetic volunteers are encouraged to contact the chair if 
they want to participate.

	  <head>Taskforce on SGML/XML Conversion</head>
	  <byline>Chaired by Christine Ruotolo, charged May 2002</byline>

<p>The NEH-funded TEI Task Force on SGML to XML Migration was convened in May
2002 and <xref
url="http://www.tei-c.org/Drafts/edw76.html">charged</xref> with
developing recommendations for migrating existing TEI resources from
SGML to XML.  The Task Force comprised representatives from
projects with significant TEI SGML, along with selected technical
experts and the TEI editors. It worked for the past 18 months to
diagnose and document the problems, methods, and tools necessary to
migrate legacy TEI data to XML.</p>

<p>The members of the Task Force met three times altogether -- in
October 2002 in Chicago (immediately following TEI Annual Members
Meeting), in February 2003 at the University of Maryland, and in June 2003
at the University of Alicante.  Minutes from each of the meetings are
available from the Task Force <xref
url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/MI/">activities page</xref>, as is a
detailed <xref
url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/MI/miw05.html">workplan</xref>
written after the first meeting.</p>

<p>The primary deliverables of the Task Force are two reports, <xref
url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/MI/miw02.html">Strategic
Considerations in Migration of TEI Documents from SGML to XML</xref> and
the <xref url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/MI/miw03.html">Practical
Guide to Migration of TEI Documents from SGML to XML</xref>.  The first
report, intended for administrators and project managers, emphasizes the
planning and decision-making involved in data migration, while the second
report describes the mechanics of conversion in greater detail and is
written primarily for the technical staff who will implement the
conversion.  The specific recommendations in the technical report are
augmented by a set of <xref url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/MI/miw06.html">Migration Case Study Reports</xref> that discuss
individual migration efforts undertaken by members of the Task Force.</p>

<p>All documents produced by the Task force -- final reports, along with meeting minutes and other working papers, are available from the TEI web site in the section given above. The information presented there is current as of June 2004; however the Task Force has fulfilled its charter and does not expect to update these materials after 01 July 2004.</p>

	<div>
	  <head>Manuscript Description Task-force</head>
	  <byline>Chaired by Matthew Driscoll, charged February 2003</byline>
<p>
The Manuscript Description Task-force was charged to reconcile or
merge the various schemes for encoding manuscript descriptions using
TEI-conformant XML (principally MASTER and the TEI-MMSS workgroup, but
also the scheme devised for the  Repertorium of Old
Bulgarian Literature).  This task has been fulfilled as of October
2004 and a <xref
url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/MS/FASC-ms.pdf">preliminary draft of the
chapter for P5</xref> was produced by the task force and is now made
available for public comment.  </p>

<p>The council recognized that this work is a first step towards a
better encoding for manuscript description within the TEI framework, and that
much works remains to be done in formalizing several aspects of the
descriptions which are currently given as running text only.</p>
</div>
	<div>
	  <head>Metalanguage Workgroup</head>
	  <byline>Chaired by Sebastian Rahtz, charged March 2003</byline>

<p>This report should be read in conjunction with other
<xref url="/Activities/META/">regular reports</xref> from the work group. </p>

<p>The workgroup held a face to face meeting in Paris in March
2004, at which the broad structure of the new ODD language for representing the
innards of the TEI Guidelines was hammered out, after many revisions
during 2003.  Some of the details
have been further polished over the following months.  One of the
remaining questions is  whether the benefit of the abstraction
from the underlying RelaxNG schema language given through the ODD
syntax made up for the disadvantage of not being able to use all of
RelaxNG syntax; however, the Council conference call in September
agreed that the ODD language should be frozen for at least 3 months to
allow the editors and others time for proper assessment of its useability.</p>

<p>The current draft of TEI P5 is fully conformant with the ODD
language.</p>

<p>The ODD processor, Roma, for delivery of customized TEI schemas in
RelaxNG, DTD and W3C Schema syntax, has been completely rewritten and
is now available as an <xref url="/Roma/">experimental service</xref>
from the TEI website, and is also available as a package for Debian
GNU/Linux systems and on a TEI customization of the Knoppix CD.
</p>

	<div>
	  <head>ISO/TEI Workgroup on Feature Structures</head>
	  <byline>TEI Liaison: Laurent Romary, charged March 2003</byline>
	  <p>This is a joint activity of the TEI together with the ISO TC37/SC4 workgroup on Feature Structures.  The aim is to revise the chapters on Feature Structure Representation (chapter 16) and Feature Structure Declaration Representation (chapter 26) and align them with the current work going on in the ISO WG.</p>
	  <p>The workgroup met in Nancy Nov. 2003, in Jeju-do, Korea
	  in Feb. 2004 and in Paris August 2004.  The <xref
	  url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/FS/FASC-fs.pdf">current
	  draft of chapter 16 for P5</xref> is available now.  This
	  chapter will form part of <xref
	  url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/FS/iso-n033-11.pdf">ISO
	  DIS 24610</xref>.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
	  <head>Workgroup on Physical Bibliography</head>
	  <byline>Chaired by Terry Catapano, charged May 2004</byline>
	  <p>This is the only new work group charged this past year.
	  It has been charged to develop guidelines for encoding
	  information about the physical structure of printed books:
	  specifically, information about how individual pages are
	  located and identified within the larger structures of
	  signatures and gatherings. The audience being served is
	  fairly narrowly construed as the community of descriptive
	  and analytical bibliographers for whom this information is
	  essential as a way of documenting the construction of the
	  physical book and as the basis for further analysis of
	  printing practices and the history of particular editions.
</p>
<p>
While this work group is not expected to cover issues specific to
manuscripts, its recommendations should not unnecessarily preclude
their use to encode similar information about manuscript documents,
and to this end this work group is expected to maintain communication
with the Manuscript Description Taskforce and to review the materials
they have already produced in this area.
</p>
	  <p>Charge, work plan and draft documents for this work group are available at <xptr url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/PB/"/>.  </p>

	<div>
	  <head>Other activities of the Council</head>

	  <p>The council was approached by John Smith, Cambridge this
	  spring with the proposal to develop markup constructs to
	  represent word boundaries in Sanskrit compound work.  The
	  council charged him with this task subsequently and
	  requested that the recommendations were developed in a way
	  that could also be applied to similar problems in other
	  languages.  Different proposals have been discussed within
	  the workgroup so far (the latest one is available at <xptr
	  url="http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/CE/sanskrit_proposal_2.pdf"/>,
	  but no final recommendations have been submitted yet.)</p>

	  <div>
	    <head>Individual Members of the Council reported the following about their TEI-related activities this past year</head>

	  <div>
	    <head>Syd Bauman</head>
	    <p>As one of the only three people who is paid to do TEI-C
	      work, I am acutely aware that part of my job is devoted
	      to those tasks that it is hard or impossible to get
	      volunteers to do &mdash; the scut work, as it were. But
	      it is certainly not the case that all is boring or
	      meaningless; quite the opposite. Some of my activities

<div><head>Lou Burnard</head>
<p>As a TEI editor the bulk of my time is supposed to be devoted to
editing other people's drafts for P5. In practice, I seem to have devoted more time to
requesting, wheedling, demanding, or provoking drafts and constructive
suggestions for revision (or facilitating production of same) than
anything else much.</p>
<p>This year in particular I have:
<list>
<item>provided drafting assistance for chapters MS, TD, and FS of P5,
as well as parts of CO.</item>
<item>proposed and implemented a way of prioritizing feature requests
on Source Forge; also provided feedback on all current such
requests</item>
<item>tested and provided design input to the redesign of the ODD
system and associated software developments</item>
</list></p>
<p>In addition, I have been active in promoting the TEI in various
forums, notably:

<p>In addition to chairing the Manuscript Description taskforce 
mentioned above, and ensuring that its outputs were made available in 
time for this meeting,
Matthew has been responsible for a number of TEI-related training and 
outreach exercises this year.
<list>
<item>I held a two-day TEI workshop at Johns HopkinsUniversity, 26 and 
27 April 2004.</item>
<item>I delivered a 90-minute plenary lecture on the TEI at  The 
Third International Conference on New Technologies and Standards: 
Digitization of National Heritage, Belgrade, 3-5 June 2004. This lecture 
will be published in the next  volume of the <title>Review of the National 
Center for Digitization</title>.</item>
<item>Anne Mette Hansen and I held a one-day workshop on text  encoding 
here at the institute on 27 March, where we introduced our colleagues 
(not for the first time) to the wonders of the TEI. Some of them 
actually now use it.</item>
<item> I organised (along with colleagues from Stofnun Árna Magnússonar 
in Reykjavík, Nordische Abteilung of Universität Tübingen and Abteilung 
für Nordische Philologie,  Universität Zürich) a week-long summer school 
in manuscript studies, 6th-10th September 2004, one aspect of which was 
electronic text encoding. We had 26 attendees from all over Europe, 
principally Germany, Switzerland and the UK. It was a tremendous 
success.</item></list></p></div>

	      <p>I have worked for the TEI in 9 areas over the last year:
<list>
<item n="a">I led the Meta workgroup in a deep revision of the ODD language
in which the Guidelines are written. I have also been responsible
for all the implementation of the processing of the Guidelines to generate
schemas and documentation.
 
</item><item n="b">I  wrote a replacement (named Roma) for the TEI Pizza Chef, which
generates customized schemas for P5. This was then rewritten from scratch,
under my supervision, by Arno Mittelbach and delivered for testing. It 
has been kept up to date with changes to the ODD language.
</item><item n="c"> I reimplemented the work of Alejandro Bia on internationalization of the
TEI element, class and attribute names, and worked with Alejandro on 
subsequent revisions. This system is supported by Roma.
</item><item n="d">I packaged some key TEI deliverables (TEI-Emacs, schemas,
 dtds, document, stylesheets, Roma) as Debian packages, according to
 the Debian XML guidelines, and produced an experimental CD for distribution to
 members</item>
<item n="e">I developed a system using an eXist database to  deliver the P5 sources
via a query system, delivered on the same CD.
</item>
<item n="f">I taught courses in Oxford on the TEI, and talked about the TEI at
 several international conferences
</item>
<item n="g">I did the initial setup of the Sourceforge project for the TEI and

<list type="gloss">
		<label>Revision of the Print Dictionary chapter</label>
<item>In the summer 2004, the Print Dictionary chapter has been fully
revised to check its consistancy with the new ODD specification
platform. This work conducted by LR in conjunction with LB and SR was
also an opportunity to experiment with extension mechanisms in ODD. A
call for contributions has been made on the TEI list to gather up
dictionary samples and observe current practices in this domain. From
the dozen answers received, some proposals have made to improve the
expressive power of the PD chapter in the domains of historical notes
and morphology.</item>
		<label>Redrafting of the terminology chapter</label>
<item>A series of discussion have taken place within the TEI list and offline 
as to the best strategy to adopt with regards the outdated P4 chapter 
on terminology. It is proposed that this chapter be fully rewritten to 
become conformant to the TBX syntax as recommended by the Localization 
Industry Standard Association (www.lisa.org), which in turn is 
conformant with the ISO 166642 standard (Terminological Markup 
Framework). The future chapter would limit its scope to a set of core 
descriptors and would explemplify extension mexhanisms for whoever 
would want an enlarged model.</item></list>
