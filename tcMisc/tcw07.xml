          <item><gi>textDesc</gi> and <gi>settingDesc</gi> and all
            their children should remain part of this module. However,
            <gi>particDesc</gi> and all their children
            (person-related) should have their inclusion in this
            module given serious reconsideration by the personography
            taskforce. At very least <gi>particDesc</gi> and children
            need to make sure that their descriptions are rephrased to
            not say these elements only apply to those <q>in a
              linguistic interaction</q>. <hi>Comment: for discussion
              at the PTF: the proposed change in wording is easily
              effected</hi>

<item>Where should prosopographic elements go: in CC, in ND, or in
their own module? Is there to be  a single module for personography? module
dependency issues: should modules have explicit dependencies?
Council agreed: not to leave in limbo. Move it into ND:
agreed by 10 votes.<note type="action">Move prosopographic material to ND</note>
</item>

<item>How should the dependency of msdescription on ND be resolved?
Should we introduce mechanisms for supporting module dependency or
should the class system do this job? Council agreed we should fix the
ms-desc/ND dependency and see if there are any others. Provide a
facility for indicating that one module should be used with
others. Rethinking of meaning of TEI classes. 
<note type="action">Revise discussion of classes in TD and test
sequential classes with msDesc</note>

</item>

          <item>Around half a dozen of these elements have a content model of
            "att.datable model.personPart". I can see people wanting to add
            things that are like this. I guess it is best for them to add both,
            but I point it out just in case it comes up elsewhere or a class
            should be made. Obviously this depends on the outcome of the
            personography taskforce. <hi>In general, we don't mix attribute and
              model classes within a single class</hi></item>
          <item>Similarly a number of elements all are members of
            "att.declarable model.profileDescPart". I think all this really
            is indicates that the class system is working properly. <hi>Phew!</hi></item>
          <item>A large number of the elements in corpus have a content model of
            <ident >macro.phraseSeq</ident>. I really think it is improbably that many of these
            elements *really* need all/most of the possible content which
            this enables for them. Of those which are <ident
            >macro.phraseSeq</ident>, those which
            I think could do with a much tighter content model would include:
            <gi>affiliation</gi>, <gi>channel</gi>, <gi>constitution</gi>, <gi>derivation</gi>, <gi>education</gi>, <gi>factuality</gi>,
            <gi>firstLang</gi>, <gi>langKnown</gi>, <gi>locale</gi>, <gi>nationality</gi>, <gi>occupation</gi>, <gi>preparedness</gi>,
            <gi>purpose</gi>, <gi>residence</gi>, <gi>socecStatus</gi>. For most of these one only needs a
            small bit of limited text without the various in-depth phrase markup
            that <ident >macro.phraseSeq</ident> seems to give. I was less sure about wanting to
            constrict the <ident >macro.phraseSeq</ident> content model for <gi>activity</gi> for some
            reason. Similarly with <gi>domain</gi> and <gi>interaction</gi>, but there I vacillated
            on whether they (as perhaps some of those above) could be made empty
            or something more constrained (<ident >macro.glossSeq</ident> didn't seem right.) I
            want to argue that <gi>birth</gi> and <gi>death</gi> (or however they are reformed by
            the personography taskforce) should have a tighter content model as
            well. <hi>This is probably true of several other things in the header
              too: do we want to define a restricted subclass of phrase
              elements?</hi><note rend="italic" resp="SB"

            think so</note>

          </item>
          <item>The most complex content models are in: <gi>listPerson</gi>, <gi>particDesc</gi>,
            <gi>setting</gi>, and <gi>textDesc</gi>. <gi>textDesc</gi> does not use classes so possibly a
            candidate for <ident>model.textDescPart</ident>. I can see someone wanting to add
            something to <gi>textDesc</gi>. <hi>Agreed: we should implement
              <ident>model.textDescPart</ident></hi>
            Otherwise, <gi>setting</gi> is the only one I would
            consider re-examining. Its content model is: 
            <code>model.pLike+ | ( model.nameLike.agent | model.dateLike |
              model.timeLike | activity  | locale  | rs )* </code>
            I looked to see if: <code>model.nameLike.agent | model.dateLike |
              model.timeLike</code> appears elsewhere as a group (it doesn't
            really).
            <hi>What's the proposal here? <ident>model.settingPart</ident>?</hi><note type="action"><list>

--------- what we have now ---------

model.phrase =

   model.hiLike = distinct emph foreign gloss hi mentioned soCalled term title
   model.lPart = caesura rhyme
   model.oddPhr = att code gi ident specDesc specList tag val
   model.pPart.data = address
      model.dateLike = date dateRange dateStruct
      model.measureLike = measure num
      model.nameLike = geogName lang placeName rs

   model.ptrLike = ptr ref
   model.ptrLike.form = oRef oVar pRef pVar
   model.segLike = c cl m phr s seg w

--------- some possible changes ---------

   model.pPart.edit = abbr add app choice corr damage del expan orig
      reg restore sic space supplied unclear

becomes:

   model.pPart.edit =
      model.pPart.edit.??? = abbr choice expan
      model.pPart.edit.transcribe = add app corr damage del orig reg restore sic space supplied unclear

---------

   model.hiLike = distinct emph foreign gloss hi mentioned soCalled term title

becomes:

   model.hilighted =
      model.hiLike = hi
      model.emphLike = distinct emph foreign gloss mentioned soCalled term title

---------

   model.oddPhr = att code gi ident specDesc specList tag val

becomes:

   model.specDescLike = specDesc specList
   model.xmlPhrase = att code gi ident  tag val

arguably <code> and <ident> should be in model.emphLike instead.

---------
summary of possible changes:

model.headerPhrase = 
   model.graphicLike [1]
   model.xmlPhrase
   model.pPart.data
   model.pPart.msdesc
   model.ptrLike
   model.emphLike
   model.pPart.???

I.e., model.headerPhrase does *not* have
   hi [2]
   model.lPart
   add app corr damage del orig reg restore sic space supplied unclear [3]
   model.ptrLike.form
   model.segLike


Notes
-----
[1] An argument could be made to divide model.graphicLike so that
    <binaryObject> and perhaps <formula> and <graphic> were not in
    model.headerPhrase. 
[2] And perhaps not distinct, either?
[3] And perhaps not reg, either?

        <head>Transcription</head>
        <p>Susan and I have continued our discussion on the attribute classes
          in <ident >transcr</ident>, specifically looking at the attributes for <gi>add</gi>, <gi>addSpan</gi>,
          <gi>del</gi> and <gi>delSpan.</gi> As they stand, these elements all have slightly
          different attributes assigned to them, but the editors may want to
          consider adding attributes currently defined for <gi>del</gi> and <gi>delSpan</gi> to
          <gi>add</gi> and <gi>addSpan</gi> and creating new classes.
          <hi>Yes, there is definitely scope for improvement here! </hi>
        </p>

        <p>Is there such thing as a "faulty addition" - an addition that
          contains too little or too much text (as a result of eyeskip, for
          example)? If so then we may want to define <ident>status</ident> on <gi>add</gi> and
          <gi>addSpan</gi>. <ident>type</ident> could be useful on <gi>add</gi> as it is for
          <gi>del</gi> (primary and secondary additions, for
          example). <hi>Agreed: <ident>type</ident> is needed on addSpan</hi></p>
        <p>There are still two differences amongst the attributes for
          these four elements: <gi>addSpan</gi> and <gi>delSpan</gi>
          share <ident>to</ident>, and <gi>add</gi>
          and <gi>addSpan</gi> share <ident
           >place</ident>. We really don't think
          <ident>place</ident> makes any sense for
          <gi>del</gi>. So, we can consider either new attribute
          classes for:</p>
        <p><gi>addSpan</gi>, <gi>delSpan</gi> (<ident
           >hand</ident>, <ident
           >type</ident>, <ident
           >status</ident>, <ident
         >to</ident>, with <ident
         >place</ident> separate on <gi>addSpan</gi>)

 "sense" is referenced directly in the content model. It is also
