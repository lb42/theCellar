<item><hi style="strong">Mailinglists@Brown University</hi>
<list style="ul">
<item>EM: Still okay to keep the current Brown TEI mailing lists at Brown, at least for the near future. Running on Listserv.</item>
<item>Transferring from Brown (Listserv) to Pipermail (what TEI-C is using on lists.tei-c.org) is possible but non-trivial.</item>
<item>Make sure there’s not a single point of failure – Council chair (at least) should be able to make/manage/admin mailing lists if desired.</item>
<item>Infrastructure group: Huma-Num will use a different mailing list software.</item>
<item>JC: per month at least one can download gzipped per month / year, e.g. on the <ref target="https://lists.tei-c.org/pipermail/tei-council/">tei-council mailing list</ref> (<ref target="https://lists.tei-c.org/pipermail/tei-council/">https://lists.tei-c.org/pipermail/tei-council/</ref>).</item>
<item>JC: This looks like it is in unix mbox format so should just be able to be imported by any sensible mailing list software. In a Huma-Num version of lists.tei-c.org should we switch mailing list software?</item>
</list>
</item>
<item><hi style="strong">Stylesheets circularity</hi>
<list style="ul">
<item>MH suggests a solution: Stylesheets get released &gt; 1 month ahead of P5, and the CI servers build dev P5 against released Stylesheets; meanwhile, Stylesheets dev builds against the released P5.</item>
<item>PS: The real problem is that Stylesheets tests are working on dated P5 subset. We’ll still have a problem with an early release of Stylesheets with the tests failing. A Guidelines release breaks the Stylesheets tests.
<list style="ul">
<item>July 2019 release: still release Guidelines with Stylesheets. Release both at the same time, and update the Stylesheets tests.</item>
<item>Or try this: build of Stylesheets Master just skips the tests temporarily.</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>Tests issue: MH: We’re currently testing by git diffs, but should be doing that with dedicated Schematron.
<list style="ul">
<item>Diff is important: include it into the process to review all diffs. It’s currently plain-text diffing. What about XML diffing?</item>
<item>Pulling P5 subset from release branch rather than current vault P5. Increment the source version forward when we realize tests are out of date. DEFAULTSOURCE is a “moving target”. Need a version number hard-coded in the makefile that makes it possible to move the target forward.</item>
<item>Tests need to prove against old AND new. This is good practice.</item>
<item>Test 2 test basis is better.</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>Action on PS to write up last release process with Paderborn Jenkins, so other Jenkins can do the same. When exactly do we update the defaultsource? (We need TCW 22 release notes for Jenkins maintainers!)
<list style="ul">
<item>Bump the version when you’re introducing a new feature, such as update to tagDocs, with new processing which isn’t caught by the old source.</item>
<item>Ordinary process of inventing new elements shouldn’t cause the tests to break. But Guidelines tests may still break.</item>
<item>Jenkins points at both dev and master.</item>

<item>Children of <gi>listAnnotation</gi>: <gi>annotation</gi> (doesn’t exist yet) and <gi>annotationBlock</gi> (already exists).</item>
<item><gi>annotation</gi> needs to be recognizable as expression of open web annotation standard. The annotation body might be a pointer with @target pointing to another document. No inline annotation body.</item>

<item>Where does metadata about standoff go?
<list style="ul">
<item>Earlier expectation from Ann Arbor that this metadata goes inside <gi>standoff</gi>, in something like a <gi>teiHeader</gi>.</item>
<item>But standoff group Council members want this to go in a real <gi>teiHeader</gi> child of <gi>TEI</gi>, not a child of <gi>standoff</gi>.</item>
<item>You could have a whole series of these bundled in <gi>teiCorpus</gi>, or in nesting <gi>TEI</gi> elements.</item>

</item>
<item>Question of where <gi>listApp</gi>, <gi>listPerson</gi>, etc. could go: at same level as <gi>listAnnotation</gi>?</item>
<item><gi>standoff</gi> was originally conceived to accommodate <gi>link</gi>, <gi>linkGroup</gi>, and other things. It wasn’t ever supposed to be just for linguistic purposes.</item>

<item>Discussion
<list style="ul">
<item>Clearly differentiate targetAnnotation and body</item>
<item>LR’s comments
<list style="ul">
<item>Is <gi>standOff</gi> recursive? (addressed in discussion of <gi>teiCorpus</gi>) (possibly by making TEI recursive).</item>
<item>Concern about multiple use-cases blurring the model.</item>
</list>
</item>
<item><gi>standOff</gi> – version of record document – text that you leave untouched without altering the content. So it needs a header.</item>
<item>Is this something that we should address today or form a working group?</item>
<item>MT: create general structure today and hold off on details, so that <gi>standOff</gi> is available for use ASAP.
<list style="ul">
<item><gi>annotationBlock</gi> is already available, so this is feasible</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>PB’s Comments
<list style="ul">
<item>standOff annotation does not originate with linguistics (e.g. Amaya – in-browser annotations with no source modification) and there are many competing variants.</item>
<item>Try to be aware of this history and keep it separate from resource (like lists of bibliography, person, etc.)</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>TEI is already rich in pointing mechanisms.</item>
<item>HC: personography can be standoff, with resource – body – annotation.</item>
<item>LR wants a <gi>resource</gi> element (that we have previously discussed as <gi>ldb</gi>).</item>
<item>MT: This is the “hinge” concept: Annotation is a singular act of that associates a passage of text with its interpretation (interpretation inlined in the annotation or pointed to and gathers additional metadata about this association.</item>
<item>PB: Compare this with Xlink.</item>
<item>GV: Can’t we just do this with the W3C model so that the TEI doesn’t have to invent something that already exists?</item>
<item>PS: Instead of calling it <gi>standOff</gi> then, just call it <gi>resource</gi>? JC: That ship has sailed.</item>
<item>PB: In Nancy Ide’s time, there were two versions of standoff. One is compressed, the other is dissociated as a (MH supplies: pure link). Merged standoff: annotation together with linking that points to text. And pure link that connects to resources, whether parallel corpora, or text on one side and some other resource on the other. Resource is not the same as standoff, because you can remove a resource.</item>
<item>LB: One of the oldest and earliest approaches to this was the element <gi>join</gi>: for a structure you can’t represent with the XML hierarchy, implemented with lots of pointers. Is that a use case for annotation or resource? (<gi>join</gi> was used for interrupted speech, for example.)</item>
<item>PROPOSAL 1:
<list style="ul">
<item><gi>standOff</gi>
<list style="ul">
<item>model.listLike or <gi>listBibl</gi>. Put <gi>listPerson</gi>, <gi>listEvent</gi>, other lists here at this level. Automated named entity recognition. <gi>linkGrp</gi>, <gi>joinGrp</gi>, etc. feature structures, <gi>taxonomy</gi>. Is the target a person element, or a web resource for more info? HC: body of an annotation can be a pointer.</item>

<item>MH: What do we do with things that belong in both? <gi>listApp</gi>, <gi>listTranspose</gi>, <gi>listNote</gi> for example? Maybe we could put them in the content model of both? Discussion: JC: No, that’s making things worse by clouding categories.</item>
<item>GV: make <gi>listAnnotation</gi> conform as much as possible to web annotation model.</item>
</list>
</item>
<item>LB: Perhaps we don’t need to create boundaries where they aren’t needed. The second proposal puts the linguists in charge of <gi>standOff</gi> and excludes other applications.</item>
<item>PS: We need separate sections in the Guidelines for personographies, gazetteers, etc. And another section on how to do unmerged standOff. Clearly distinguish sections for use-cases.</item>
<item>HC: Disagrees: There’s no clear separation of these use-cases. During the process you are identifying the entities to which you want to point. And there are distinct ways to write a personography. One may be a standoff way. Another may not, and there may be varying degrees of remoteness of resources.</item>
<item>GV: Think about the ‘Text as Graph’ community, and how they would apply Proposal 1.</item>
<item>General appreciation of the simplicity of Proposal 1.</item>
<item>LR reiterates that the name of the <gi>standOff</gi> element needs a capital ‘O’.</item>
<item>PB says he now accepts proposal 1 (with mild preference for proposal 2) but not enough to argue for it. He feels the second is more analytic and preserves more of the original sense of standOff. GV: It’s a distinction between the analytic and the practical. RV: Some of these lists really would apply to both places (resources vs. standOff). JC: we are doing better future-proofing. The analytical form is not necessarily the better one when the analysis will inevitably break.</item>
