<item> Called to order @ 09:01. JC thanks everyone for coming. </item>
<item> JC: Agenda alternates between discussions and ticket breakout groups. </item>
<item> JC: Discussion of how ticket discussion and feedback will work for new
                        members. </item>
<item> LB: In the new system, all tickets get a default classification of
                        Amber. Some, however, get no classification. Some of the Ambers right now
                        were not assigned that setting; they got it automatically. We should be
                        alert to the fact that the Amber label may not mean that anyone has looked
                        at it. </item>
<item> JC: Any comments on how we should proceed? </item>
<item> KH: If we’re reviewing previous actions through the wiki page, and
                        updating it, we need to make sure only one person is editing the wiki table
                        at the same time. I volunteer to do that. </item>
<item> JC: At some point we will specify a release date, and an implementation
                        date by the time of which we should have all tickets assigned to us
                        completed. </item>
<item> JC: “Code Bounty” = some funds we have to perhaps spend on
                        community-based code development that benefits the work of Council </item>
<item> JC: Anything else missing from the agenda? </item>
<item> SR: Will there be another meeting this year? </item>
<item> JC: We have budgeted for one and that has been approved by the Board. </item>
<item> SR: We should decide when and where, in that case. </item>
<item> JC: We’ll discuss that later. </item>

<item>KH: Re Google: An engineer at Google has been working on TEI
                                    output of public domain books. There is a group of people led by
                                    Peter Gorman at Wisconsin pushing this forward. We have looked
                                    at some sample files, and provided feedback and tips on the
                                    output, conformance with Best Practices etc. The engineer has
                                    now disappeared, and things appeared stalled, but PG has
                                    recently restarted the process; the engineer (Ranjith)
                                    re-appeared; and KH and others have been invited to join the
                                    Google quality group, so we should be able to push this forward
                                    without there being any official Council involvement. At one
                                    point, it seemed that the code was basically ready and Ranjith
                                    needed to get corporate buy-in to get it into the Google output
                                    pipeline, but since then things have moved slowly.</item>
<item>JC: One of the previous concerns was related to quality of
                                    Google output; It looked as good as one could expect from OCR’ed
                                    text.</item>
<item>LB: This action has been treading water for some time. I
                                    suggest we create a wiki page in which people recount their
                                    experiences in converting Google-sourced texts into TEI.</item>
<item>PS: Has anyone actually done that?</item>
<item>SR: We can’t get access to their code, so we can’t test it
                                    ourselves.</item>
<item>KH: They also use structural information accessible to them
                                    but not in their public documents.</item>
<item>We need to demonstrate our own interest in this to keep it
                                    moving forward.</item>
<item>MH: Does our own work converting Google OCR to TEI have
                                    anything to do with Ranjith’s project to produce it
                                    automatically?</item>
<item>LB: The wiki page would be about people’s own experience
                                    doing this.</item>
<item>EM: We should put out a call to TEI-L to see who has done
                                    this, and how successful it has been.</item>
<item>PS: What are the existing Google Books outputs?</item>
<item>KH: ePub, PDF.</item>
<item>JC: If you ask nicely, they may give you OCR text.</item>
<item>JC: So: We’ve removed this action from Council, and we’ll
                                    just keep a watching brief, and receive reports from KH and
                                    others on the working group when they’re available.</item>
<item>KH: I don’t want to cut Council out, and I want to keep
                                    pointing back to the work we did but I will note that the action
                                    to review samples and provide feedback. Anyone still interested
                                    should look at the email and examples and provide feedback if
                                    you can. Those samples should still be current.</item>
<item><hi style="bold">Action on KH: to email Council to solicit
                                       volunteers for TEI Google work, and provide a link to the

<item>Schematron constraint on contents of <gi>app</gi>: ticket
                                    still open. Original agreed action reversed; ticket is with GB,
                                    and only outstanding action is to add examples. </item>
<item><hi style="bold">Action on GB: to add examples of schematron
                                       constrains on contents of <gi>app</gi> as the (Green) ticket
                                       says.</hi></item>
<item>LB: Re Attributes without examples: I spent a month looking
                                    at French translations, and it became apparent that in the
                                    English there are huge inconsistencies in how attributes are
                                    described and exemplified. We should standardize this before
                                    following KH’s suggestion to ask TEI-L readers to submit
                                    examples. The table is overly alarming because many attributes
                                    don’t really need examples.</item>
<item>SB: We should break the table up and divide it amongst
                                    ourselves; then we should use a new column to assign priority to
                                    those which really need examples.</item>
<item><hi style="bold">Action on RW and BB: to categorize the table of
                                       attributes without examples by adding a column with
                                       priorities of high, medium and low. </hi></item>
<item>EM: What we need to establish is what we mean by “important”.
                                    If reading a reference page as a newcomer does not give you
                                    enough information to be able to use the attribute, it needs an
                                    example.</item>
<item>Discussion of div.liminal stuff — LB had written spec for
                                    “flashy” website to solicit community input, which MH had said
                                    he could not implement (w/o funds) because of the authentication
                                    framework. LB/s should have come back w/ simpler suggestion; MH
                                    suggests Code Bounty to implement as written.</item>
<item>SB asks for background on the ticket and the proposed
                                    application, and LB explains it.</item>
<item>LB: The number of people likely to want to contribute to this
                                    is a handful, so we probably don’t need the authentication
                                    framework. We could have a couple of Council members volunteer
                                    to field these items, and then insert them into the
                                    database.</item>
<item>SB: How many examples are there?</item>
<item>PS: There are a few dozen.</item>
<item>JC: How about setting it up so that you have to email someone
                                    to get an account?</item>
<item>SB: If you put this call out on TEI-L, you could have dozens
                                    of people volunteering.</item>
<item>JC volunteers to be the person who creates/administrates the
                                    account for individual users in order to get some progress on
                                    this issue.</item>
<item>GB: Could we leave it open for anyone to edit?</item>
<item>MH: Too many security issues.</item>
<item>JC: So let’s build the application. </item>

<item>JC: Re Allow certainty in milestone elements: This ticket is
                                    red and requires more discussion. </item>
<item>KH: Should we put this in a breakout group discussion?</item>
<item>JC: Yes, if there’s time at the end.</item>
<item>JC: Specification for a Roma rewrite: I started on the spec,
                                    but haven’t finished it yet, so that’s ongoing.</item>
<item>KH: Liaising with the Physical Bibliography workgroup: they
                                    never finished doing their work, and I tried to get a group
                                    going that was interested in this. Lots of people were
                                    interested but no-one has really stepped up, so we should
                                    probably form a workgroup to deal with this.</item>
<item>SB: The thing the original group got hung up on was: are we
                                    encoding the collation formula as it exists in the world, or are
                                    you encoding the information that collation formula contains?
                                    Are you encoding the catalogue formula itself, or the info from
                                    it? EpiDoc has managed to handle this, so we might be able to
                                    learn from that.</item>
<item>KH: I can’t take the lead on this, because I lack the domain
                                    expertise. I think if there were other Council members able and
                                    willing to lead the interested people, we would make more
                                    progress.</item>
<item>EM: If despite our leadership the people concerned don’t
                                    produce anything, would we not care?</item>
<item>JC: For instance, if we were able to add elements or
                                    attributes that make msDesc look more friendly to encoding early
                                    printed books, that would help. (e.g. typeDesc)</item>
<item>LB: Marjorie Burghart’s work on cheatsheets would be useful
                                    here.</item>
<item>LB: I know a Portuguese person working in France who do this
                                    work regularly.</item>
<item>EM: The way physical bibliography is done differs from
                                    country to country.</item>
<item>KH: Perhaps we could ask LB’s friend to produce
                                    cheatsheets.</item>
<item>LB: Actually I know two specialists in bibliography we could
                                    ask. They are both French speakers and their work would have to
                                    translated.</item>

                              that there is an argument in principle for concatenating the two
                              pieces of information, but it’s not strong, and doesn’t overcome the
                              convenience of having two. Datatype could be taken from
                              application/@version, or LB’s new data.versionNum (see below). </item>

<item> LB: still objects to idea of resp being global: this is the

<item> GB: Can we discuss this and the new ticket on @source
                                    together? </item>
<item> GB now realizes that all(?) circumstances in which @resp
                                    might be used should be using @source. </item>
<item> LB: My principled reason for resisting expanding the global
                                    class is that it’s already very large, and puzzling, and we need
                                    to be very careful before extending that class. Also, there is a
                                    thin-end-of-the-wedge argument; and finally, there is the
                                    argument that tracking responsibility is better handled by a
                                    version-control system. </item>
<item> SB: Would <gi>respons</gi> not be appropriate instead? </item>
<item> EM: <gi>respons</gi> is for the markup of the element. </item>
<item> KH: If <gi>respons</gi> should have this wider sense, then we
                                    should rewrite it. </item>
<item> EM: The example also has the word “value” in it; the intent
                                    is clearly responsibility for markup, not for the information
                                    contained in it. </item>
<item> KH: OK, so we should first decide whether we want
                                    <gi>respons</gi> to have this broader use. </item>
<item> LB: The guidelines text supports the broader interpretation
                                    for <gi>respons</gi>. </item>
<item> GB: We need to make this explicit, not only in the chapter

<item> @from by itself should denote a start point with an

<item> Using @from without @to really should mean “from here on”. </item>

</list>
</item>
<item> SB: My instinct is to reverse the first option, and say that
                                    @from without @to means the single node, and we need a way of
                                    specifying “to the end”. </item>
<item> EM: Bear in mind it’s not a pointer, it’s data.word. But
                                    whatever we should do, we need to differentiate. </item>
<item> KH: Even if it isn’t a pointer, it needs to work the same
                                    way as all the other @from and @to cases, where @from alone
                                    means “to the end”. </item>
<item> LB: Because the semantics of the attribute are so different,
                                    we should deprecate @from and @to here, and create different
                                    attributes. </item>
<item> EM: If you say p5ff, you don’t mean all the way to the end;
                                    you mean “until no longer relevant”. </item>
<item> JC: The problem is just that the definition needs to be
                                    clarified. </item>
<item> All now agree that for a single page, both @from and @to
                                    should be supplied, with the same value. Where @from is provided
                                    alone, we need to clarify that the range starts there, but its
                                    end is not known or declared. </item>

<item> LB: We also need to clarify when and why people would use
                                    <gi>biblFull</gi>. </item>
<item> JC: You could use <gi>sourceDesc</gi> to contain it. </item>
<item> KH: But then it would apply to the source, not the current
                                    item. </item>
<item> KH We should also add it to <gi>fileDesc</gi>. </item>
<item> JC: <gi>fileDesc</gi> and <gi>biblFull</gi> are identical
                                    except for some attribute classes which don’t make sense on
                                    <gi>biblFull</gi>. </item>
<item> KH: If we add it to <gi>fileDesc</gi>, it should go after
                                    <gi>sourceDesc</gi>. </item>
<item> SB: If it’s repeatable (which it should be), it should
                                    appear after <gi>sourceDesc</gi>. </item>
<item> LB: If we add it to <gi>biblFull</gi>, it should be added as
                                    a child of one of <gi>biblFull</gi>’s children. </item>
<item> KH: But if we do that, it applies at the level of its
                                    parent, not at the level of the whole <gi>biblFull</gi>. In the
                                    bibliographic world, it would not be a child of something else. </item>
<item> JC: So why not put it in a <gi>notesstmt</gi>? </item>
<item> KH: We have created an element called <gi>relatedItem</gi>,
                                    and told people to use it for this purpose. </item>
<item> HC: It is a sort of note, so it belongs in
                                    <gi>notesStmt</gi>. </item>
<item> KH: So <gi>relatedItem</gi> is a sort of semantic sugar for
                                    &lt;note type=”relatedItem”&gt;. So the modified proposal is to
                                    add <gi>relatedItem</gi> as a repeatable child of
                                    <gi>notesStmt</gi>. We add it separately (not adding it to
                                    model.noteLike, to avoid its showing up in other places where we
                                    don’t want it. That handles <gi>fileDesc</gi> and
                                    <gi>biblFull</gi> </item>

<item> KH introduced the history of the discussion, and brought it down
                              to the distinction between “hard” and “soft”. </item>
<item> JC: Soft means that we don’t exemplify it, and we encourage other
                              ways to do whatever it is. Hard means we will get rid of it. But
                              really these terms are imprecise and we should talk about deprecation
                              and ‘dis-recommended’. </item>
<item> SB: Doesn’t “hard” mean P6? </item>
<item> JC: Not necessarily, but we have a wiki page for things we think
                              should only be changed in P6. </item>
<item> GB: Do we really want soft deprecation at all? </item>
<item> JC: The canonical example is @key, which we should stop suggesting
                              and exemplifying, but not actually remove. </item>
<item> KH: We have an attribute status=”deprecated” which we can use in
                              specs, and this is rendered into a red “deprecated” statement. Do we
                              want this to appear for both soft and hard? </item>
<item> SB: So the difference is that for hard deprecation, we intend to
                              remove the item from P5 at some stage. </item>
<item> SB: Hard deprecations should actually have a date associated with
                              them. </item>
<item> MH: A date allows people to stop building schemas against current
                              releases at the latest point compatible with keeping the item. </item>
<item> JC: Should this be dates or version numbers? </item>
<item> LB: Version numbers would be better. </item>
<item> SB: Ordinary users don’t know what the version numbers are. </item>
<item> JC: But the only reason for the version numbering changing is to
                              account for this sort of change. </item>
<item> GB: But we cannot predict what the number will be. Dates are more
                              reliable. It should be a date, and it should always be at least a year
                              out from the release in which the deprecation itself is enacted. </item>
<item> MH: We should add a Schematron warning for items removed from the
                              system. </item>
<item> KH: Summary: First decision: hard or soft deprecation. Soft: no
                              change till P6, but we will use status=”deprecated”, and add to the
                              wiki page about P6 dev. We pledge not to remove it in P5. </item>
<item> HC: Deprecation warnings for soft and hard should be distinct, but
                              not just using colours. </item>
<item> SB: We want to discourage people starting new projects from using
                              the item, but not prevent those who already are using it and have
                              toolchains based on it from continuing. </item>
<item> BB: How about “scorned” instead of “deprecated” for soft? </item>
<item> EM: We really do want to discourage people from using the item in
                              both cases. </item>
<item> JC: We should have two values, “deprecated” and “no longer
                              recommended”. </item>
<item> EM: This (soft deprecation) is wishy-washy. If something is going
                              to go away, then we should be clear about it. </item>
<item> GB: The example of @key is a good one; we no longer recommend it
                              because @ref can do the same job. </item>
<item> RW: We should stop using the word “deprecated” for the soft
                              version. </item>
<item> SB: For hard deprecation, we should just use the actual date of
                              the proposed removal rather than a status value. </item>
<item> JC and MH don’t like using a date in @status. </item>
<item> KH: @status=”deprecated” @when=”[proposed-removal-date]”. </item>
<item> GB: Schematron should also force the use of @when when
                              @status=”deprecated”. </item>
<item> SR: That’s ugly — two interdependent attributes. </item>
<item> MH: how about @removalDate? We wouldn’t then need @status for
                              that, but it could be there. </item>
<item> MH: I still think we need the two attributes, one for the status
                              and one for the date. </item>
<item> RW: Re intention: I think the intention behind soft is that we
                              think there’s a better way to do what you’re doing; the intention
                              behind hard is that ??? </item>
<item> SB: “Soft” means I shouldn’t have to go back and change my
                              project… </item>
<item> EM: Is hard deprecation something that is morally obnoxious, or
                              something that will cause other things to break? Or is it just that
                              keeping something is out of step with the way the Guidelines are
                              moving, so there’s a good reason for removing it? </item>
<item> LB: Hard means there’s a principled reason for removing it. Soft
                              is for situations in which multiple ways to do something exist, and we
                              recommend one of them, but we understand that a large number of users
                              are happy using it. </item>
<item> GB: Softness should be replaced by a note. Let’s get rid of it
                              from the discussion. </item>
<item> General agreement. We are back to only hard deprecation. </item>
<item> KH: Summary: Type 1 (formerly “soft deprecation”, now “no longer
                              recommended”): We have identified a preferred alternative way of doing
                              something. We do not currently plan to remove the non-preferred way
                              from the Guidelines. We’re not going to use an attribute for this;
                              we’re going to use one or more notes in the spec. Type 2 (formerly
                              “hard deprecation”, now just “deprecation”): This item is to be
                              removed in P5, and a notBefore date is specified. A Schematron rule
                              will be added. </item>
<item> Further discussion suggested replacing @notBefore with
                              @removalDate or @validUntil. We settled on @validUntil. Our practice
                              would be for the date provided to not be any sooner than two years
                              from the date on which you are adding the deprecation to the spec. </item>
<item> GB: Should this just be a 4-digit year, in most cases? </item>
<item> MH: A precise date is better. </item>
<item> KH: It’s easier for us to know that the date should be a specified
                              time from today. </item>
<item> EM: We should give a full date, to help users plan properly. </item>

                                 <list style="ul">
<item> JC: The purl.org URL redirects are very useful because
                                    they’re short and stable, but now obsolete. Is it worth mapping
                                    the old ones to the new ones? SF currently maps them
                                    automatically, but we don’t know how long that will last. Should
                                    we create a new purl syntax, or just use the SF one? The new
                                    URLs are short enough. </item>
<item> Everyone agrees that we don’t need to create a new set of
                                    purl.org redirects. </item>
<item> KH: Could we write to SF and get a mapping of the old to the
                                    new ids? </item>
<item> JC: We have an XML dump of the pre-Allura SF content. </item>
<item> KH: We should put a copy of that in the Vault. It would be
                                    helpful to have that in the future. </item>

<item> SB: How big is the problem? </item>

<item> JC: purl.org is used three times in the wiki. </item>

<item> HC: Google finds 67 links on the TEI wiki. </item>

<item> GB: If we decided this was important, how difficult would it
                                    be to change these links? A Python script could follow each link
                                    to find out where it ends up, and make the change. It would have

<item> Splitting out additional resources such as Stylesheets to their
                              own projects/repositories <list style="ul">
<item> JC: As part of our tidying up the repository, we had
                                    Sebastian remove some things which weren’t expressly maintained
                                    by Council. Should we now split out other things? The
                                    Stylesheets are a good example of this. Currently if we give
                                    people write permissions on the repo, they have permission to
                                    change everything. We would rather like to encourage a broader
                                    development community to work on the Stylesheets, so it might be
                                    good to split it out into a separate project. </item>
<item> SB: I see no problem. </item>
<item> MH: The Jenkins builds are currently set up to build
                                    everything using the Stylesheets latest build; if we make it
                                    easier for people to break the Stylesheets, that’s a risk. </item>
<item> SB: We can decouple those processes on Jenkins. </item>
<item> KH: Is there a risk of people breaking the main builds by
                                    introducing errors into the Stylesheets? Would it be better to
                                    have a branch-and-merge approach, so commits are approved before
                                    ending up in trunk? </item>
<item> JC: There is another option: we could fork the Stylesheets
                                    so we have one version for building the Guidelines only. </item>
<item> SR: But for e.g. DTD generation, both sides (projects) would
                                    need it, so it should be central. </item>
<item> LB: If we are going to make a division, it should be between
                                    production/processing of ODDs and everything else. We hope there
                                    will be more and more people wanting to process ODDs, whether or
                                    not they’re connected to the Guidelines. </item>
<item> SB: My instinct is to ask Sebastian what he wants to do. </item>
<item> SR: Why this comes up is that want to make it possible for
                                    other people to collaborate on the Stylesheets. </item>
<item> We all vaguely agree that TEI doesn’t need to own all sorts
                                    of things (such as docx to TEI) which aren’t really TEI
                                    business. </item>
<item> SR: A more interesting target is to get more people involved

                                 https://sourceforge.net/p/tei/bugs/543/ </ref> Use of `<gi>add</gi>`
                              etc for “authorial” interventions </item>
<item> The issue is the ambiguity of the word “editor”, because to us the
                              current GL text doesn’t seem contradictory. GB thinks the distinction
                              is between “modern editors/encoders” and “historical/ancient/whatever
                              authorial interventions”. PS suggests “contains letters, words, or
                              phrases inserted in the _source_ text by an author, scribe, annotator,
                              or corrector”, and “should not be used for additions made _to the
                              current TEI electronic edition_ by editors or encoders. In these
                              cases, either the <gi>corr</gi> or <gi>supplied</gi> element should be
                              used.” The distinction between the two is the responsibility of each
                              individual project, but the TEI recommendation once that decision is
                              made should not be ambiguous. </item>
<item> LB: Old versions of the Guidelines explicitly permitted the use of
                              <gi>add</gi>, <gi>del</gi> etc. for changes made by editors of the
                              electronic TEI edition of the text. The distinction in usage was
                              introduced subsequently. </item>
<item> GB: Perhaps this is not our business; the distinction between
                              changes made by different editors at different times is an issue for
                              the project itself, not for the TEI. </item>
<item> LB: In that case, we’re re-asserting the fact that you should only
                              use these elements for changes to the original source. </item>
<item> EM: But now, according to GB, the transcriber/creator of the
                              edition could be a medieval monk working on a text from antiquity. </item>
<item> GB: The question is what your source is. </item>
<item> HC: So the only case in which it’s forbidden to use <gi>add</gi> is
                              when it’s you making the change. </item>
<item> GB: Yes, but that’s not the only case where you shouldn’t use it. </item>

<item> recap of new governance document </item>
<item> New document focuses on: 
<list style="ul">
<item> how board/council should work individually and together:
                                    bestow equal responsibility for governance/big decisions on the
                                    two bodies. This adds to the council’s work load, but may be of
                                    more benefit to all. </item>
<item> how TEI should interact with members </item>
</list>
</item>
<item> SB: is this a re-org that re-apportions responsibility among
                              council and board? or does it manage communications among them? EP:
                              both, but board has less control over council in the new scheme. One
                              big change is that board no longer chooses the council chair. Council
                              chooses its own chair. This also makes the chair less
                              powerful/important. And anyone elected to council should be ready to
                              serve as chair. </item>
<item> SB: abbreviated term of office of chair (could be as short as 1 or
                              2 years) – might be a problem. Earlier meetings had discussed making
                              council terms longer, even. Worth trying, but worth revisit. EP: if
                              council thinks 3 year terms are desirable they can make a proposal to
                              Council next year, after new system has been in place. </item>
<item> SB: Finds change in # of board members mind boggling. Explanation:
                              Bylaws say 12 members. We’ve been electing 10, but have 3 appointees
                              (Chair and board rep, and Board chair) – actually 13. So would
                              actually lose 2 appointed members – Council chair and the Board chair,
                              for a total of 11. Martin: odd number of voting members is better. </item>
<item> NB: next election will have 1 fewer positions, in order to bring
                              number of annual new council members to 5 each year. </item>
<item> SR: conflating 2 issues (democracy and $) are we changing the
                              number to achieve accountability? or to save $? EP: this is ratifying
                              an existing condition. 10 elected members. </item>
<item> SB: points out that appointed people have worked very hard in
                              response to EP’s point that elected council members have more skin in
                              the game. </item>
<item> SR suggests wording change since this is going to the membership:
                              don’t beg question about why the council is reducing members. EP: very
                              amenable to new wording. send it on </item>
<item> SR, SB and others suggest it’s better for Council to be given a
                              budget, not to change the number of council in the bylaws. </item>
<item> EP: Clarification. change in number of council members has as its
                              goal to make bylaws match practice. This is also more economical.
                              Change in how Chair ie selected is a separate issue, and is motivated
                              by a desire to make council more autonomous </item>
<item> Suggestion that Council counter-propose 11 elected members. – JC:
                              too many members may end up forcing us to have fewer meetings,
                              especially as budgets are tightening. HC: let’s wait until this is a
                              problem. EP: Board prefers to prepare for the future, and budget will
                              definitely shrink, because of abolition of partners. </item>
<item> EP: summarizes – She will take proposal of 11 members back to the
                              Board. MH: adds that council has done a good job shepherding its
                              budget, and has leftovers. EP: This is expected. JC: and add that we
                              won’t ask for an increase in budget. </item>

</list>
</item>
<item> SB: why not give partners a vote? SR: what would make them happy? </item>
<item> EP: TEI isn’t good at thanking institutions that contribute even
                              if they aren’t partners. </item>
<item> KH: Tension – making TEI fully democratic vs. letting institutions
                              who are contributing in a big way have a voice. </item>
<item> EP: Explains that a lot of contributions to the TEI now come from
                              individual. So worth giving them a vote, as well. LB: points out that
                              it’s good to separate voting from financial support. </item>
<item> EM: Do we have analogies for these two issues? I have no idea why
                              Brown, which is trying to cut right and left, would give in a
                              philanthropic way to the TEI. Brown isn’t going to see why they should
                              be supporters. </item>
<item> LB: I don’t think the ability to vote would make any difference to
                              this. </item>
<item> EP: Brown for example could pay $250 and have the same vote. It’s
                              not that it buys you more votes. The current issue is how we can
                              recognize the contributions of major contributors, which we don’t
                              currently do. The situation is already such that the money you pay
                              doesn’t get you votes. The money you pay is to support something you
                              think is important We do expect that institutions paying $5,000 will
                              stop doing so; six or seven have already dropped out. We’d like
                              members to tell the TEI what they want from us, and get more feedback
                              than we’ve had. Currently, all you do is get an invoice and pay; the
                              person that votes is not the same person who pays, necessarily We’re
                              trying to build a different relationship with the members. </item>
<item> KH: (is this still consortial?) – There is a risk that the change
                              may make institutions feel that instead of supporting a group of peer
                              institutions, they are instead supporting a group of individuals
                              pursuing their own interests. PS: Libraries are used to be in
                              consortia, they join them along with peer libraries. They don’t fund
                              standards or other external activities. </item>
<item> LB: two kinds of memberships: Consortial and member based. EP: a
                              possible alternative: individual members might get to elect a member
                              for council, consortial members may elect the Board. </item>
<item> SR: what if anyone who is a member on the list gets a vote. Ex.
                              Digital Medievalist. JC: This works there because DM has no financial
                              remit. </item>
<item> EP: explained what she’d do to poll institutional members, get
                              feedback from them, find out what they find attractive. Individual
                              contacts, polls. </item>
<item> KH: intrigued by bi-cameral solution. Institutional members elect
                              board, ratify bylaws, membership elects council. There is general
                              support for this idea. </item>
<item> EP, SB: clarify that in bylaws, changes can be passed by
                              membership quorum or board. this may have to be adjusted. </item>
<item> EP: summary:

<item>JC Thanked EP for attending via Skype to clarify the

<p>EP’s report back to the TEI Board (included with her permission)
                                 summarized this as:</p>
<p> I had today a very fruitful discussion with the Council about the
                                 proposed reforms to the governance of the TEI. Our discussion has
                                 centred in particular on two aspects of the document which I report
                                 to you for discussion. </p>
<list style="ul">
<item> Number of members of the Council. The proposal is to go from
                                    12 to 10, ratifying what has been in practice the situation in
                                    the past and to have them to choose a chair among the elected
                                    members. This latter aspect has the consequence of the Council
                                    to downsize from 11 (10 + chair) to 10 and this has actually
                                    been not taken easily be the Council. They object to any
                                    reduction of the number of their members because they strongly
                                    believe that even losing one person would be detrimental to the
                                    activities of the Council. Again, they stand on the position
                                    that they will work with whatever budget we set for them, so if
                                    the reason for reducing the number is financial, they simply
                                    said they will live with whatever we will be able to give them.
                                    So their proposal is to have a Council of 11 members, which will
                                    also have the positive effect of solving hanging discussions as
                                    it is a nice odd number. </item>
<item> Vote for individual subscribers. While all the members of
                                    the Council felt that in principle to enlarge the base of the
                                    voters and to recognise the fact that the TEI is evolving into a
                                    scholarly community as well as consortium is a very good thing,
                                    many voices, in particular Council members coming from partners
                                    such as Brown and Michigan, thought that his is very risky as it
                                    may convince partners to withdraw their support. In particular
                                    they thought that establishing the equivalence between
                                    institutions and individuals will effectively stop the TEI from
                                    being a Consortium of Institutions and therefore will make
                                    impossible for libraries to support it. Their counterproposal is
                                    to have the elections split in two: the Institutional members
                                    will vote for the Board and any change on the Bylaws, while
                                    individual members will vote for the Council. In this way, the
                                    TEI will keep its status as consortium, with members controlling
                                    its policies and finances, while individual members, for which
                                    day-to-day contribution the TEI as a standard and as a scholarly
                                    community lives, will control the development and maintenance.

<item><hi>Code Bounties</hi></item>
<item> We have worked hard saving money in council expenses, especially through
                        institutional contributions towards council members expenses, the Board has
                        given us permisssion for us to use this for technical development that will
                        benefit the Council’s work. We need to decide . </item>
<item> Proposals: 
<list style="ul">
<item> community-developed Roma replacement </item>
<item> translations. OmegaT is an open-source translation workbench, i.e.
                              software to help professional translators. Small amount of
                              money<lb/>JC: So the benefit would be not only that OmegaT would have
                              a small TEI module in it, but the people doing translations would
                              understand it and do a better job.<lb/>SB: And the first advantage is
                              that you can do translation of TEI documents with out understanding
                              TEI itself.<lb/>JC: We’re confusing two things here: the ODD editing
                              environment is not the same thing as tweaking the Stylesheets to
                              produce better docs.<lb/>JC: Part of the limitation of the code
                              bounties is that we’re looking for small, modular projects that we can
                              fund.<lb/>LB: What we need is a young (=cheap) person who is
                              incentivized to learn about the Stylesheets.<lb/>SB: So someone who
                              has advanced XSLT skills. If the rewrite of Roma were to go ahead,
                              this would be obviated.<lb/>KH: There is a tool called Thutmose II
                              partially developed by Michael Sperberg-McQueen to convert MARCXML
                              records to TEI headers; it would be great if Council could fund that
                              work.<lb/>JC: How does that work help Council? Other proposals are
                              directly related to Council’s work but this isn’t. </item>

                                    new. Not maintenance. </item>
<item> BB: Board has been talking about this. Laura Mandell
                                    proposed at an earlier meeting to create screencasts. There is
                                    also the document that was started as a beginner’s guide. JC:
                                    Marjorie proposes “Cheat sheet,” also similar. </item>
<item> JC, LB: Code Bounties should further work of the council, so
                                    the doc is good, but not as germane. ‘ </item>

<item> SB: URI resolver that understands xpointer. it would be ok if it
                              were in XSLT. JC: clarify, this could be a stylesheet modification
                                 <list style="ul">
<item> HC: has been doing some work on this. It requires being able
                                    to parse xpaths – means extensions to xslt2. </item>
<item> JC: do we have a need for this? MH: there is a pat of the
                                    guidelines that is essentially theoretical without something
                                    like this. </item>

<item> KH: propose to instruct a few people to decide what these bounties

<item> MH: Roma: do we start with the backend first, make an API (command

<item> Report on TEI SIGs activities (JC) </item>
<item> Report from the Music SIG: Activity at the Music SIG is very low at the
                        moment. Though I know of a couple of projects that are using
                        tei:notatedMusic and I am working with Frieschuetz Digital for a coordinated
                        edition of score and libretto sources. I am planning a SIG meeting in
                        October, so I hope to re-establish some community activity in summer. </item>
<item> Linguistics SIG: Not much to report so far. The convener intends to stir
                        the SIG somewhat and populate its SourceForge space, well before the TEI
                        Conference where we’re planning an extended SIG meeting there. </item>
<item> Overview from JC: JC with SB resurrected the TEI-SIGS mailing list, went
                        back to SIG leaders, and did housekeeping. Two responses above. Goal to see
                        what kind of technical demands they need and whether they have anything to
                        report that should be brought to the Council’s attention. </item>
<item> LB: follow up on non-responsive sigs. JC: trying not to crack the whip
                        too much LB: but if they are not doing anything, should see what’s going on.
                        JC: there is a mechanism for this. He will use the mailing list to confirm
                        that they still consider themselves to be active. </item>
<item> NB: SIGs can take 2 forms: one is a a group that is producing focused
                        work. the other is group of people with shared interests </item>

<item> Translation of Guidelines : what practical issues are needed to

<item> LB: Proposal from Florence Clavaud – work on it with her students.
                              To achieve this, propose to split guidelines files up according to top
                              level divs inside a chapter. </item>
<item> MH explains one reason to break down to segments because can use
                              SVN to diff them and know when they have to be re-translated. If it
                              was at the chapter level, then prompts to re-translate will be too
                              frequent. </item>
<item> JC: is this needlessly complicated? SB: small price to pay </item>
<item> LB has meeting at the end of the month w/ person at Uni. Bordeau –
                              interested in translating guidelines into French and Arabic. </item>
<item> JC: why did these issues not come up? LB: Earlier efforts were a)
                              one offs. b) only element descriptions. these new suggestions are
                              different, as it applies to all the prose. For ex. what to use for
                              examples. – from real sources, equivalent. </item>
<item> Recommendations for how to translate the guidelines. </item>
<item> EM: When translations are offered, especially in languages we
                              don’t know, how do we know whether the translation bears any
                              relationship to the TEI? How do we evaluate the Guidelines in Arabic,
                              say? </item>
<item> LB: Good question. But we shouldn’t discourage people from making
                              translations. </item>
<item> JC: We have lots of TEI material out in the world that’s written
                              in other languages, and we’re not curating the foreign versions of TEI
                              Lite; should we be accommodating the translations of the Guidelines,
                              or should we keep them at arm’s length? </item>
<item> KH: And we aren’t in a position to vet the translations of specs
                              in all the languages. The original plan was that the English version
                              would remain canonical; maybe what we need is for any translations we
                              might be hosting, we need some sort of disclaimer saying it’s not an
                              official translation. </item>
<item> MH: The responsibility rests with the community that generates the
                              translation to maintain and vet it. </item>
<item> EM: This is where the community can actually make the Guidelines
                              apply to their own problems. </item>

<item> JC: summary of ticket and background to ticket and original change
                              with P5 from m/f/u/x to 0/1/2/9 values. Ticket raised as community
                              feedback on principle rather than a specific use case. Reason for
                              adopting ISO 5218 is that TEI tries to adhere to applicable standards
                              when they exist. The argument is not only that the standard has
                              failings which as they can be found offensive the TEI should not
                              promote but also that it is not suitable because of its own
                              limitations. The affected attributes are sex/@value, person/@sex, and
                              personGrp/@sex as well as any example and the prose of the Guidelines. </item>
<item> GB: problematic not only because potentially offensive, but
                              ISO5218 is inadequate. He suggests that @sex could be locally defined.
                              This doesn’t break previous use of ISO5218, and allows people to
                              extend as required. </item>
<item> EM: Most of what we’re dealing with is cultural objects so gender
                              identity is likely to be what @sex encodes, and this is a good example
                              of a case where we’re trying to make TEI inclusive and accepting, so
                              locally-defined attributes are an easy and effective option here;
                              chromosomes are certainly a bad way. </item>
<item> Proposal: GB: we change data.sex to be data.word. Also need to
                              change prose and examples. </item>
<item> LB: suggests that @sex was intended as normative and therefore
                              useful for encoding and processing thus LB suggests deprecating @sex. </item>
<item> JC: Although these values are normative I feel that this is such a
                              complicated area where the community wants to record many values which
                              are not catered for by this ISO 5218 standard. I believe it was a
                              mistake for us to adopt this standard. </item>

<item> Update on the work of the Text Directionality Working Group (MH) <list style="ul">
<item> MH presented slides (<ref target="https://wiki.tei-c.org/images/4/48/Text_directionality.pdf">
                                 http://wiki.tei-c.org/images/4/48/Text_directionality.pdf </ref>)
                              to give background on text directionality in order to present three
                              proposals for us to consider. Slides show that we need to address
                              three properties of a run of text: line orientation, block flow
                              direction, inline glyph orientation </item>
<item> GB: We might need to account for writing that starts at the center
                              and spirals outward, and to handle writing that goes around a bell in
                              a helix. </item>
<item> MH (continuing slides): I think those are edge cases that can be
                              reduced to the three properties of a run of text. We need to deal with
                              directionality and rotation (including idiosyncratic exceptions).
                              Unicode handles horizontal directionality quite well. There’s a
                              bidirectional (“bidi”) algorithm for working out rules on which
                              direction text should run in, yet there are five codepoints designed
                              purely to force directionality for a text run (when the algorithm is
                              insufficient). Unicode 6.3 will add four new “bidi isolate” codepoints
                              to override this. But this all deals with mixed-mode horizontal
                              directionality. </item>
<item> UTN #22 deals with vertical text layout, but very little progress
                              has been made since it was written. UTR #50 addresses glyph
                              orientation in vertical text, but the only thing to come out of it is
                              adding one new property of a codepoint for default glyph orientation
                              for when a horizontal glyph appears as part of a vertical text run.
                              That’s all that Unicode has done for vertical directionality! </item>
<item> Proposal #1: Ignore what Unicode is doing. Their own UTR #20 says
                              not to use control characters for bidi writing in XML markup. After
                              all, inherent directionality from the Unicode Character Database is an
                              issue for text editing tools (like &lt;oXygen/&gt;), not for markup
                              (like TEI). </item>
<item> LB: What happens when you search? MH: You That type characters in
                              the order they you expect them appear in the file (the logical
                              sequence). </item>
<item> MH: We would need to warn people about possible interactions
                              between bidi characters and markup. Should the TEI’s stylesheets
                              remove those characters during transformations? </item>
<item> Note that the CSS Writing Modes module will handle much of what we
                              are trying to do except there’s no support for bottom-to-top writing
                              for some reason. </item>
<item> Proposal #2: Adopt or recommend the CSS Writing Modes module. It
                              covers most of what we need. Can just use with @tei:style. Lacks
                              bottom-to-top. </item>
<item> But it’s not supported in tools yet. PS: Most browsers support
                              basic ??directionality control characters??. </item>
<item> This is still really hard. We can cover a lot of simple
                              requirements with better rotation features (like zone rotation in TEI
                              encoding). </item>
<item> Proposal #3: @rotate-x, @rotate-y, and @rotate-z. This would
                              handle many of the examples previously given in the slides. </item>
<item> None of these proposals deal with writing along paths (like in a
                              spiral). SVG is probably better for this. </item>
<item> LB: Since none of the options does everything, what if we do
                              nothing and tell people just to use SVG? MH: It’s a cop-out for people
                              who are trying to encode texts. </item>
<item> JC: Why not store the path order using TEI’s points in a zone? </item>
<item> EM: Is there a distinction between text as text and layout? While
                              the proposal keeps them straight, our discussion is muddling them. </item>
<item> MH: We can handle bottom-to-top using rotation, and
                              glyph-orientation. </item>
<item> KH: Could we just lobby the W3C to expand CSS Writing Modes to
                              include bottom-to-top writing? </item>
<item> MH: Not sure. Afraid that we would complicate it and they would
                              back away, just as Unicode did with their implementation. </item>
<item> SR: Reimplement CSS Writing Modes in TEI? </item>
<item> SB: Suggests talking to W3C working group about CSS. The spec
                              could add bottom-to-top and still allow software to ignore. MH: But
                              W3C won’t recommend anything unless there are at least two
                              implementations. SB: But we have friends in the W3C, like Liam Quin.
                              MH: I would like to ask them why they abandoned bottom-to-top. Is it
                              just because there are few languages that use this direction which are
                              already in Unicode? There are a number of such scripts which are
                              candidates for inclusion in Unicode, so maybe it’s also a matter of
                              time. KH: This seems like the direction to go to me. </item>
<item> GB: I don’t like using directionality for boustrophedon because
                              boustrophedon is not inherently left-to-write or right-to-left. SB:
                              But a scholar encoding it could choose either as the default with the
                              other is the exception. How this is handled now: just encode the text
                              in the reading order and provide a facsimile. </item>
<item> LB: There are texts for which there isn’t one clear reading order,
                              and you might want to represent this in the encoding. </item>
<item> MH: We could say to use CSS Writing Modes for direction and then
                              use a rotation attribute for character rotation. PS: Or use a
                              <gi>g</gi> for these characters. </item>
<item> LB: I agree with ignoring the Unicode directionality documents. We
                              already allow people to use CSS in TEI, so you just need for the
                              guidelines a clear statement of scope (what you can do with your TEI
                              markup after you’ve created it). </item>
<item> RW: You are trying to say things about the pattern for the whole
                              text, not specific characters. </item>
<item> LB: You transcribe in reading order? MH. Yes. This is important to
                              say. </item>
<item> SB: If you are encoding a boustrophedon text in <gi>sourceDoc</gi>
                              using <gi>line</gi> and <gi>zone</gi>, do you put the characters in
                              reading order or as arranged on the page? </item>
<item> LB: You put them in reading order. GB: Do so as long as you can
                              tell what the order is. </item>
<item> LB: Proposal #3 is inadequate since it doesn’t handle many things.
                              MH: Yes, you just have to tell people to use SVG for anything that’s
                              not simple. </item>
<item> JC: Need to make clear when describing this to users that we are
                              talking about describing the text, not how to render output from it. I
                              know we know this, but because we’re using CSS and SVG people easily
                              fall into the assumption that it is output-related. MH: And CSS is for
                              more than just superficial rendering issues: it can include things
                              that are intrinsic to the document. </item>
<item> EM: Once you go beyond a raster representation, you head down a
                              slippery slope for knowing the reading order of a text. MH: Yes, and
                              when you decide on this order in the encoding, you are creating a
                              theory of the text. EM: And we should allow people different ways of
                              representing the text. MH: It’s dangerous for us to draw these lines
                              too clearly. Most of any recommendations we add will be exemplary
                              rather than prescriptive. </item>
<item> RW: Any value in having indirection that describes writing
                              direction? Something like declaring a language and elsewhere saying
                              that it is written in a certain direction? [much discussion followed] </item>

                        Boilerplate <list style="ul">
<item> He’s been railing against the section of the Guidelines because it
                              doesn’t give enough information to implement it in any software. A
                              working group has worked on it on and off over the years. He has the
                              beginning of a proposed rewrite to this section of the Guidelines.
                              Needs feedback. It’s very complex and takes a while to understand in
                              order to comment on it. Please let him know if it doesn’t make any
                              sense. </item>
<item> His implementation lets you highlight a section of a document that
                              is annotated and scroll to it. SB: Note that demo just shows source
                              documents in first two bullets; later bullets include proposed pointer
                              syntax in the URL. </item>
<item> MH: How do you get Javascript to not interpret that as an ID? HC:
                              It interprets after loading. </item>
<item> HC: His use of TEI Boilerplate uses HTML5 instead of XHTML5. </item>
<item> Highlights of the proposal: <list style="ul">
<item> XPath would be redefined to encompass XPath 2.0. SB: Or just
                                    use XPath 2.0 instead! </item>
<item> Guidelines don’t make it clear that you shouldn’t nest other
                                    XPointers as the parameters to an XPointer, but they should. SB:
                                    That’s because at the time we wrote the Guidelines this wasn’t
                                    included in the spec. HC: So the ID has to be an XML Pointer or
                                    an absolute XPath. MH: Would that also be XPath 2.0? HC: Yes. </item>
<item> You should be able to match a regular expression, not just a
                                    bare string. </item>
<item> Add string-index in order to pop into the middle of a text
                                    node. </item>
<item> SB: Do we need the match pointer any more? Can we get away
                                    with Xpath functions? HC: No. The match function doesn’t return
                                    a node. The XPath must return a node, not an atomic value. MH:
                                    Can’t it return true or false? HC: Yes, but that’s an atomic
                                    value (which has no context). [further discussion] </item>
<item> JC: Instead of specifying XPath 1.0 or 2.0, why not just say
                                    to use the latest version adopted by W3C? KH: Do we elsewhere in
                                    the TEI say to use the latest version of a standard? Others:
                                    yes. </item>
<item> We discussed Hugh’s comment in his Google Docs document
                                    about returning the element containing the match. We think we
                                    have a way around it. </item>
<item> We discussed the definition of a “point”. It’s just a
                                    location between two things. SB: But is it to the left or right
                                    of a tag? Can be hard to process. HC: But you can’t retrieve a
                                    point. </item>
<item> When specifying a range, you can say that something begins
                                    before or after certain characters or tags. </item>

                                    In short, you can accomplish most things using XPath, but there
                                    are enough edge cases to warrant the existence of the XPointers.

<item> EM: General question: Do we set deadlines on actions? SB: Maybe

                              to leave these flexible where possible since we all have busy work
                              schedules. However, we will try to be implementing most tickets

<item> P5 longer-term development roadmap brainstorming (JC) <list style="ul">
<item> We’ve been discussing medium-term actions (e.g. P5 3.x.x) but not
                              where we want P5 to go in the long run (in P5 version 5.x.x and
                              6.x.x)? </item>
<item> MH: I want to drop DTDs. Various: Amen! </item>
<item> KH: Do you mean simply not allowing Roma to create them, or are
                              there content models we’ve wanted to implement in the ODDs but haven’t
                              because we couldn’t in a DTD. </item>
<item> SR: There’s a difference between not being able to and it being
                              hard. </item>
<item> But do you really think we should? SB and MH: Yes! JC: While I
                              wouldn’t have said this in 2005, I’m tempted to agree that we should. </item>
<item> LB: We should separate discussion of expressibility of the ODD
                              language and generation of DTDs. SB: I think that’s reasonable. MH:
                              Our assumption is that DTD, XSD, and RELAX NG are equivalent. SB and
                              LB: But it’s already the case that each expresses different
                              constraints from the ODD. </item>
<item> In designing the ODD language, we only tried to implement
                              something that could be expressed in all three languages (“the
                              intersection”). But now we’re now proposing for a major revision of
                              the TEI that we instead expand ODD to allow for expression of content
                              models allowed in only one schema language. This would put a burden on
                              customizers and the ODD processor to handle things that today aren’t
                              in the intersection. </item>
<item> JC: The ODD meeting also suggested that we support things in ODD
                              that aren’t yet implemented in any schema language. </item>
<item> SR: Why go out of our way to antagonize people by removing DTDs?
                              We’ve already paid the price of implementing. SB: But if we have
                              someone do a new ODD implementation (apart from Roma), it will be a
                              lot harder for them to do if they have to output DTDs as well. </item>
<item> LB: Ambiguous content models are a pain, but they’re a good pain
                              because they force us to clarify our thinking. </item>
<item> KH: We don’t say anywhere that if you implement an ODD processor,
                              it must output DTDs. So if another implementation doesn’t support
                              DTDs, we could choose to be okay with this. </item>
<item> SB: The question of whether to continue supporting DTDs is not
                              really about future major revisions to the TEI; rather, it’s about
                              community relations. </item>
<item> JC: Other areas of the Guidelines for future growth? <list style="ul">
<item> SB: Support for epistolary correspondence </item>
<item> PS: Liturgy </item>
<item> BB: Lack of support for historical journals and newspapers.
                                    MH: There’s a lot of overlap between journals and
                                    correspondence: overlap and reference to each other. </item>
<item> BB: Ephemera </item>
<item> SB: Handwriting on forms. </item>
<item> KH: Ongoing assessment of wiki cheatsheets to see if there’s
                                    text that should be added to the Guidelines to fill in gaps. </item>
<item> KH: For historical journals and newspapers, there are two
                                    problems: complex layout (which is now handled using the genetic
                                    editions methods) and metadata of articles versus an issue or
                                    journal as a whole. SB: You can do this with @decls. KH: Maybe
                                    we need a cheatsheet. LB: Or if we invent the proposed “linked
                                    data block”, you could possibly put this in the <gi>front</gi>.
                                    JC: Or do this as a <gi>teiCorpus</gi> with each article as a
                                    <gi>text</gi>. </item>
<item> SB: Add better support for having separate files for
                                    components of a text? </item>
<item> EM: Is the problem with using <gi>teiCorpus</gi> and separate
                                    headers for each article is that there’s so much to type? </item>
<item> BB: Some want metadata for text-bearing objects. </item>
<item>JC: For each of these areas it would be good to get some more
                                    concrete proposals written up</item>
<item> SR: Matthew Driscoll wants a way to markup things that don’t
                                    exist (I checked and it doesn’t exist, as opposed to I’m not
                                    sure.) JC: I have in the past suggested using an empty element
                                    for such uses. SB: But then people can’t use empty elements as
                                    placeholders. LB: In <gi>msDesc</gi>, there are two categories of
                                    elements: those that talk about things, and those that represent
                                    them. </item>
<item> MH: You could have a global attribute on an element to say
                                    that it’s not present in the text. </item>
<item> RW: This is like what bothered me about text directionality:
                                    how do you encode an expectation that’s not fulfilled? EM: Or,
                                    more generally, the things that don’t conform to pattern. This
                                    is different from presence versus absence. </item>
<item> MH: I’m worried that Matthew is trying to encode rendering.
                                    You should instead do that through your encoding toolchain. </item>
<item> JC: Perhaps another example might be: you have a set of
                                    illuminated manuscripts but one doesn’t have the illuminated
                                    letter as expected. PS: I have a paper from 17 years ago
                                    (“Encoding Silences”) about cases of missing expected data from
                                    the Middle English Dictionary. MH: Our use of @notBefore and
                                    @notAfter is an additional way of encoding silence, so we do
                                    have a precedence for asserting absence through the encoding.
                                    SB: And <gi>supplied</gi>. But PS wants to express a default. </item>
<item> BB: The genetic editions stuff is missing the genetic part
                                    (relations among genetically related documents: the revision
                                    campaigns). It’s mostly the diploma stuff that got implemented.
                                    Others: this is in fact there. JC: listChange; however this
                                    relates aspects of a single TEI file or node, not amongst them.
                                    LB objects to the use of the word ‘file’ to describe what most
                                    operating systems call a file. </item>
<item> Discussion of representing genetic relations and relations
                                    among <gi>TEI</gi> nodes. You could use Graphs, Networks, and
                                    Trees for this. JC: That is ridiculous. We need simple
                                    mechanisms for relating one <gi>TEI</gi>
                                    element/node/digitalRepresentationOfADocument with others or
                                    other resources, or showing their place in a series or
                                    collection of these. The limitation of the genetic material is
                                    not in relating stages in a single document but stages as
                                    recorded in multiple TEI files. </item>
<item> SR: Need to expand support for contextual information: not
                                    just persons, places, and organizations. For example, trees
                                    (actual plants, not a computer science concept!). JC: Is this a
                                    general purpose description of objects? SR: The <gi>object</gi>
                                    element could eventually be used for this. (The SIG has gone
                                    dormant.) </item>
<item> JC and MH: Overhaul of the TEI header. JC: Could do this in
                                    a Birnbaum-friendly way that allows you to chose between the old
                                    and new header structures. </item>
<item> SB: Being able to express non-TEI metadata in some sort of
                                    “other metadata” element in the header (and not just strewn
                                    about in other places but in another namespace). </item>
<item> JC thanks Council for the brainstorming and we will attempt
