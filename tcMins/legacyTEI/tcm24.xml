           <item>Resolve remaining unresolved issues about new file organization at Sourceforge asap, and report on status at Kyoto Council meeting.
            <note type="action"><label>JC</label>Update HOWTO to reflect the new structure and check that the discussion of SVN procedures introduced in it are all correct</note>
           </item>
           <item>Discussed structure of internationalization file structure <label>LB</label> suggests testing ODD tools so that linking works as opposed to copying. <label>CW</label> says basic structure should include how to handle examples in different languages.
            <label>SS</label> asks did we not once ask people for examples?
            <label>CW</label> says someone will have to be in charge of handling the call and collecting examples.
            <label>SS</label> suggest that if we collect samples we need metadata (form similar to
             the TEI projects page)</item>
          
          <item>Should chapter file names change? (i.e. hd &gt; header). Consensus is "no".
          <note type="action"><label>JC</label>suggest new file names.</note></item>
          
          <item><label>SB</label> updated his <xref url="http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2005/001163.html">report on SO output documents</xref> to include recommended dispositionsas a working paper for discussion in Kyoto. Recommendation is SVG should be used instead of graphic and figure.
          <label>CW</label> and <label>DP</label> suggest that graphic element stays and that SVG
            exists in the module for figuers and tables.
          Do we dicuss this in the guidelines and where do we discuss it?. Should part of the
            guidelines be dedicated to other lanaguges? (markup and standards).
          <label>CT</label> suggests a new pointing method that includes coordinate pointing.

        Should there be a disticnct module for the new elements in personagraphy? If yes, how does
        it affect other modules? LB proposes persongraphy stays in limbo for the time being. make a new module, or put in another module.
      Vote: 10-4 in favor of putting personography into names and dates. Editors will do it.

          Syd's proposal: While I don't like how att.spanning works (mostly because it is not
          "horse-like" enough), I agree completely that <gi>addSpan</gi> and <gi>delSpan</gi> belong
          in that class. I like Dot and Susan's third suggestion: hand, type, status in new class
          att.subEditStuff of which all 4 are members; place in new class att.placement of which
          <gi>add</gi> and <gi>addSpan</gi> are members (and can <gi>note</gi>be a member of this
          class, too?); and <gi>addSpan</gi> and <gi>delSpan</gi> get added to the already existing att.spanning.)</p>
