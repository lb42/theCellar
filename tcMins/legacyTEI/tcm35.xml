                  <item>Revision of this chapter is almost
            complete; SB reports that most all has been completed
            except replacement of one example, and the
            provision of English examples throughout as hoped for by
            Council last meeting. However, SB had thought that because
            deadline had passed, we were simply foregoing the English
            examples. Council thought otherwise, and expressed a
            desire to have the English running example in place even
            now. <note type="action" anchored="true">

                     <hi>LB</hi> reports that there are no changes to report; still possible that there may be last minute changes from their side; LB and LR are pushing to get action from the responsible person at the ISO.</item>

                     <hi>DO</hi> reports that this was done, but received such luke warm to cold reception from the editors that he decided there was more to lose by introducing these kind of changes this late in the process.

                  <item>In absence of JC and DP at this point of the call, Council discussed the nexts steps more generally. Decided to call the web design closed except for bugs and errors to comment from TC members on 9-28, while encouraging TC members not to raise major changes before that time. Acceptance or rejections of suggestions delegated to JC and DP. With reassignment of SB back to editorial duties, he will be leaving the site in the hands of JP and DP (with support from SR as needed). JC and DP are to begin liasing with Chris Ruotolo to ensure the integration of the new tei-c.org site and the P5 site. DO is to facilitate this integration process. The TC felt that the webmast from the main board site should have over all leadership responsibility.<note type="action" anchored="true">

            <head>Additional Items for Discussion</head>
        
            <p>There were two additional items for discussion on the agenda: <list type="simple">
                  <item>Bibliography</item>
                  <item>Formatting of the Guidelines: decision process for confliction proposals (e.g. formatting "bug" in empty elements like <gi>specDesc</gi>)</item>
               </list>
        The second of these topics was discussed during our review of the relevant action item; only the bibliography question was discussed in detail here.</p>
        
            <div>
          
               <head>Bibliography</head>
          
               <p>A vigorous discussion of where we stood and what was involved took place. Minutes became hard to keep and it was agreed DO would post a summary for review. All action items are currently dated to 10-15 pro forma; but some need to be completed before others.</p>
          
               <p>In short: the Gudieline's "bibliography" will contain three parts: <list type="simple">
                     <item n="1">Suggested Reading</item>
                     <item n="2">Works Cited</item>
                     <item n="3">Sources of Examples used in the Guidelines</item>
                  </list> The <label>Suggested Reading</label> section is derived from the 180 or so items in an unstructured bibliography supplied by Kevin Hawkins and Susan Schreibman. DP agreed to take this list, compare it to the 50 or so items in our current Works cited and remove duplicates from the reading list. LR will then convert the Reading List to biblStruct in the same way he and his magic workshop have just finished the Works Cited List. Meanwhile, AC is also collecting sources for examples for use in our "Sources" list. The actual implementation of this part of the bibliography (i.e. the linking of documentation to examples) will be effected by SR. Meanwhile again SR and LB will be converting <gi>bibl</gi> in the text of the guidelines to <gi>ref</gi> pointing at the works cited list.</p>
