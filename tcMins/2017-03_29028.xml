     <p>The theme for this meeting is putting to bed long-term, difficult tickets. We will start
      with <ref target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1431">#1431 </ref>, and progress to <ref
      target="https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1453">#1453 </ref>if we don’t run out of time. We
      should also briefly discuss whether to do an XSLT release and accompanying oXygen plugin
      release soon, to get in front of the new oXygen release.</p>

     <head>Clarify how to encode short-form citations #1431</head>
     <p>Bibliography is hard.</p>
     <p>The consensus from the ticket seems to favor using <gi>bibl</gi> with @id to encode your
      long-form “back of the book” bibliographic entries, and then to use <gi>ref</gi> and @target
      to wrap short citations in the text. This isn’t the only type of short-form citation that
      occurs though. Short-form citations can occur in the absence of a fuller bibliographic
      reference. Short citations might refer to abstract “works” rather than to specific edition
      (e.g. <hi style="i">Hamlet</hi>, <hi style="i">Hom. Il.</hi>) or they might refer to a
      specific edition using a conventional syntax (e.g. <hi style="i">IG I³ 40</hi>). All of these
      might occur in a text without a ‘referent’ elsewhere in the text. The suggestion has been made
      that these kinds of bibliographic references are akin to the kind of name—named entity
      relationships that occur with <gi>persName</gi> and <gi>person</gi> or <gi>placeName</gi> and
      <gi>place</gi>, and that therefore @ref might profitably be added to <gi>bibl</gi> to
      accommodate this kind of relationship. Others argue that @corresp is a satisfactory way to do
      this. But, perhaps crucially, the referenced entity might not be defined in TEI. &lt;bibl
      ref=”<ref target="http://catalog.perseus.org/catalog/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001"
      >http://catalog.perseus.org/catalog/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001</ref>“&gt;Hom.
      Il.&lt;/bibl&gt; might be a reasonable thing to do, for example. Others argue that &lt;ref
      target=”<ref target="http://catalog.perseus.org/catalog/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001"
      >http://catalog.perseus.org/catalog/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001</ref>“&gt;<gi>bibl</gi>Hom.
      Il.&lt;/bibl&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is the right thing to do. The semantics of @target don’t seem to
      me to work for this, but we ultimately define those semantics, so…</p>
     <p>I’ve outlined my understanding of the semantics of the relevant attributes below:</p>
     <p><hi style="strong">@ref encodes the relationship: <gi>name</gi> refers to &lt;named
      entity&gt;</hi></p>
     <p><hi style="strong">@target encodes the relationship: <gi>reference</gi> points to
      <gi>target</gi></hi></p>
     <p><hi style="strong">@corresp encodes the relationship: <gi>element</gi> is aligned with, or
      defines something related to <gi>element</gi></hi></p>
     <p>Council homework is to read this, and the discussion on the issue, and bring an opinion to
      the discussion.</p>
     <p><hi style="b">Discussion</hi></p>
     <p>Should we put @ref on <gi>bibl</gi>?</p>
     <p>Assume we have decided that a short form citation is a <gi>bibl</gi>, right? If you want a
      <gi>citedRange</gi>, yes.</p>
     <p>Case 1: standard bibliography in a journal article</p>
     <p>Need to clarify use of <gi>ref</gi> or <gi>bibl</gi> + <gi>ref</gi> +
      <gi>citedRange</gi></p>
     <p>Case 2: want to link a short citation to a canonical identifier for the work</p>
     <p>Bibliography, like health care, is hard</p>
     <p>@ref vs @corresp: What is the difference?</p>
     <p>@corresp: Is it like @like or @sameAs?</p>
     <p>Recommend that short form citations that have a cited range, should be done as <gi>bibl</gi>
      so <gi>citedRange</gi> be added. If the citation is a <gi>ref</gi> it can be wrapped in the
      <gi>bibl</gi>.</p>
     <p>Recommend adding @ref to <gi>bibl</gi> – this should be used to point to ??</p>
     <p>Discuss adding @cRef / @target which may be parallel and often mutually exclusive. NOPE</p>
     <p>Reluctance to add @cRef .</p>
     <p>If short form citation is pointing to longer citation in same universe, what do we
      recommend?</p>
     <list style="ul">
      <item>@ref seems to be useful to point to authority or more canonical object (linked data ish
       link)</item>
      <item>@corresp could be used to point to longer form of same citation, Case 1 above.</item>
      <item>&lt;ref target&gt; or &lt;ptr target/&gt; inside the <gi>bibl</gi></item>
     </list>
     <p>Martina’s rdf ex. In the guidelines : @ref on <gi>bibl</gi> to point to RDF file</p>
     <p>What if we want to point to RDF, AND to long-form bibliography entry:</p>
     <p>@ref should be able to coexist with element <gi>ref</gi> Or handle with <gi>ref</gi> and
      <gi>ptr</gi> </p>
     <p>Syd: Demonstrate each example twice:</p>
     <p>Once with attributes: @ref and @corresp A second with a <gi>ptr</gi> child using @type
      attributes to explain what’s going on</p>

    <div type="h3">
     <head><gi>path</gi> should exist alongside <gi>zone</gi> for non-closed areas in
      facsimile #1453</head>
     <p>Martin Holmes asked for a @path on <gi>zone</gi> to express things in images (especially
      maps) that aren’t boxes (roads, river courses, etc.). We said <gi>zone</gi> has area, and
      therefore @path wouldn’t make sense. Martin then asked for <gi>path</gi> (based on Council’s
      feedback). We weren’t happy with that either. This hits right at the heart of where the
      boundaries of TEI are. Should we add <gi>path</gi>? Should we back off from implementing our
      own version of SVG, but allow @path on <gi>zone</gi>? [Note: I’m in favor of something like
      this that allows @path or <gi>path</gi>, with this understanding: TEI isn’t doing the drawing
      in the coordinate system, but it provides storage of needed descriptive information, which can
      later be readily processed by transformation into SVG (or KML, etc).Apologies if this is a bad
      analogy, but we store URLs in TEI that are not activated as “hyperlinks” until they are
      transformed or translated into something readable by a web browser. The function of the TEI
      here seems to be to hold text-encoded data that describes and can helpfully be processed and
      translated into other formats.]Should we allow neither? Should we recommend using SVG and
      specify how?</p>

    <head>Use Cases and Examples</head>
    <p>Elli: This is my Zotero approach:</p>
    <p>&lt;bibl xml:id = “b1” &gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;ptr type = “biblItem” target = “zotero:IIP-043.xml” /&gt; &lt;!– “iip-043.xml” is the
     zotero “loc in archive” field value. — &gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;/bibl&gt;</p>
    <p>Element <gi>ref</gi> or <gi>ptr</gi> isn’t<hi style="b"> necessarily</hi> good for short form
     to point to long-form.</p>
    <p>Elisa: my approach for pointing to a long-form listBibl in a project directory:</p>
    <p>&lt;bibl corresp = “#IDElsewhereinProsopDoc” &gt;</p>
    <p><gi>author</gi>Joe Writer&lt;/author&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;/rdf:Description&gt;</p>
    <p>Hugh:</p>
    <p><hi style="b">Use Case 1</hi>: I have a full bibliography at the end of my TEI document and I
     have short citations in the text.</p>
    <p>&lt;bibl xml:id=”tarrant2016″&gt;<gi>author</gi>Tarrant, R. J.&lt;/author&gt;
     <gi>title</gi>Texts, Editors, and Readers: Methods and Problems in Latin Textual
     Criticism&lt;/title&gt;. <gi>pubPlace</gi>Cambridge&lt;/pubPlace&gt;,
     <gi>publisher</gi>Cambridge University Press&lt;/publisher&gt;,<gi>date</gi>
     2016&lt;/date&gt;.&lt;/bibl&gt;</p>
    <p>And in the text, current recommended practice would have:</p>
    <p><gi>bibl</gi>&lt;ref target=”#tarrant2016″&gt;Tarrant (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;
     <gi>citedRange</gi>ch. 7&lt;/citedRange&gt;&lt;/bibl&gt;</p>
    <p>I think equally valid, and maybe superior, would be:</p>
    <p>&lt;bibl corresp=”#tarrant2016″&gt;Tarrant (2016) <gi>citedRange</gi>ch.
     7&lt;/citedRange&gt;&lt;/bibl&gt;</p>
    <p>There is an open question whether @ref on <gi>bibl</gi>, if it were available, would be
     better/equivalent.</p>
    <p><hi style="b">Use Case 2</hi>: I have no bibliography as such, but a bunch of citations in my
     text to canonical works.</p>
    <p>&lt;bibl ref=”urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi013″&gt;<gi>title</gi>in Cat.&lt;/title&gt;
     <gi>citedRange</gi>3.16&lt;/citedRange&gt;&lt;/bibl&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;bibl ref=”urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002″&gt;Hom. α <gi>citedRange</gi>ll.
     1–10&lt;/citedRange&gt;&lt;/bibl&gt;</p>
    <p>The URIs in the form ‘urn:cts:etc.etc’ are identifiers for the works referenced here—not to a
     specific edition. This is like Martina’s example.</p>
    <p><hi style="b">Use Case 3</hi>: I might equally well have a full bibliography that lists
     editions used, but want to tie the edition to a canonical identifier:</p>
    <p>&lt;bibl ref=”urn:cts:latinLit:phi0474.phi013″&gt;<gi>author</gi>Cicero, M.
     T.&lt;/author&gt;, &amp; <gi>author</gi>Dyck, A. R.&lt;/author&gt;
     (<gi>date</gi>2008&lt;/date&gt;). <gi>title</gi>Catilinarians&lt;/title&gt;.
     <gi>pubPlace</gi>Cambridge, UK&lt;/pubPlace&gt;: <gi>publisher</gi>Cambridge University
     Press&lt;/publisher&gt;.&lt;/bibl&gt;</p>
    <p>Syd argued during the meeting that I probably want to do this with a <gi>ptr</gi> inside the
     <gi>bibl</gi> instead. My discomfort with that is that I don’t consider the reference URI to be
     a part of the bibliographic entry, but instead a useful way of identifying it that ties it to
     an authority system.</p>
    <p><hi style="b">JC (after the meeting): Did people bring up why @ref on <gi>title</gi> isn’t
     good for </hi><hi style="b">Use Case 2</hi> [Note: You’ll notice Use Case 2, part 2 has no
     title, as such. Yes, Classicists are problem children. I think the answer is that since title
     will not always work, we might be better off standardizing on bibl/@ref because it’s the
     container of the citation.]<hi style="b"> &amp; 3? To me Use Case 1, I think @corresp is fine.
     But </hi><hi style="b">another option</hi> [Note: Is that a less invasive change than allowing
     @ref on bibl?] [Note: That seems less invasive a change, because <gi>ref</gi> is for
     references, and the only reason <gi>citedRange</gi> wasn’t in it is that we created
     <gi>citedRange</gi> later.]<hi style="b"> is allowing <gi>citedRange</gi> and friends inside
     <gi>ref</gi>. I.e.</hi></p>
    <p><hi style="b">&lt;ref type=”bibRef” target=”#tarrant2016″&gt;Tarrant (2016)
     <gi>citedRange</gi>ch. 7&lt;/citedRange&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</hi></p>
    <p><hi style="b"><gi>ref</gi> is for references, short form bibliographic references are
     references, QED: Use <gi>ref</gi> for short form bibliographic references. 😉 </hi>[Note:
     That’s fine *if* your model for your text considers the short form citations to be pointers to
     the long form. I think that’s valid, but I also think it’s valid to model citations as names of
     Works. Sometimes they’re pointers, and sometimes they’re more like <gi>rs</gi>. I don’t think
     there’s a single, simple answer to the problem. I think we need to enumerate the use cases and
     exemplify them in the GLs] [Note: I think short-form citations are _always_ pointers to a long
     form even if that long form is some imaginary never expressed concept. But even if it is a
     reference for which the encoder is _not_ pointing to something then it is still a reference. If
     I put <gi>ref</gi>Cummings, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and no other bibliography or list of works cited
     then it is still a reference. I just think people shouldn’t use <gi>bibl</gi> for things that
     are full bibliographic entries and use <gi>ref</gi> when they refer to things. If I was arguing
     for standardisation that is the direction I’d encourage. ;-)]</p>
