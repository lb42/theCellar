<item>MT raises issue of same people being re-elected repeatedly; JC and EM are not planning to run for Council so it will ensure we have at least 2 new members on the Council.</item>
<item>EM raises the question of specific roles that are always needed for the Council to continue operation: infrastructure, stylesheets, Guidelines editing, teaching perspective. We could ask the nominating committee to work on the slate proactively so that we have candidates to fill these roles.</item>
<item>EM also reminds us that there should be some capacity to recognize “invited member/expert” status like e.g. continued access to tei-council list.</item>

<item>PS suggests we revisit the infrastructure status in 2 months to check where we are.</item>
<item>PS: release of (old) Roma and OxGarage? Wants to release in a week or two. Currently it only works on dev branch, so it would make sense to do a release; increment Oxgarage to v2.11.0. <hi style="b">Action on PS</hi></item>

<item>SB: suggests possibility of a <gi>link</gi>-like solution of pointing to both things. (Though how we point to something in an RNG schema we don’t control will be something we need to overcome…)</item>

<item>RV prefers “Roma”. Calling the old one “Old Roma” or “Roma Classic” or “Retro Roma” or “Roma Antiqua”</item>
<item>PS: We’re going to need a different subdomain to distinguish the two.

<list style="ul">
<item>nonlinear textual features (was called “extratextual”):
<list style="ul">
<item>SB notes examples like acrostics, anagrams, solutions to crossword puzzles, ciphers, codes, etc.; JC and EBB: we don’t need specific elements for these use cases.</item>
<item>EBB: Maybe a single generic element that indicates text that is not read in the expected sequence. Give a @type with suggested values.</item>
<item>EM: need a standoff wrapper/holder, like <gi>nonlinear</gi></item>
<item>EBB: ergodic (a text that is meant to be entered from multiple places and read in multiple directions, like George Herbert’s poem, “Angel Wings”.) RV: But does that confuse things with ergodic literature. EBB: it’s maybe one use case for this generic element, whatever it is.</item>
<item>JC: An example is Wilfred Owen’s letters home to his mother, he has a code word ‘Mistletoe’ in the text which then signals that the second letter of the next lines on the page will spell out the location he is currently stationed at. The point being we need not only to point to the individual letters in the text, but the piece of text which signals this (similar to the ‘clue’ in the crossword). Also ways to signal that indicates text is to be read non-linearly after a certain point.</item>
</list>
</item>
<item><gi>ldb</gi> vs. <gi>standoff</gi>: Is it really a “linked data block” in our current understanding of linked data (in the semantic web sense)? Also ldb is less clear than standoff.
<list style="ul">
<item>RV: <gi>standoff</gi> works as an overarching concept inclusive of linked data</item>

<list style="ul">
<item>MT: Following <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model">Web Annotation</ref> standard with body and target. Annotation unit is a hinge connecting two ends. Indicate what is annotated, and what is said.</item>
<item>Laurent Romary at first wanted to repurpose <gi>interp</gi> element. In the course of discussion, the group decided on a new element, called <gi>annotation</gi> with two attributes, maybe: @body?, @target? which could each accept multiple pointers.</item>
<item>HC: there are two styles for web annotation: 1) body is property of annotation (string or markup), or 2) that it is a pointer to somewhere else. We would want versatility of either.</item>
<item>RV: Consider that body is the body and it can be a pointer, why not express that as <gi>ptr</gi>, and have the possibility for multiple of these</item>

<item>Here the “body” is composed of the <gi>ptr</gi> elements.</item>
<item>We should be able to include a <gi>p</gi> to explain this annotation.</item>
<item>MT: We should keep this as flexible as possible.</item>
<item>HC: You could have annotation that has just a target without a body. Perhaps not the other way around (not possible to have body without annotation). Maybe <gi>ptr</gi> isn’t semantically rich enough for the w3c model?</item>
<item>RV: If this is TEI, it should include TEI features people are used to.</item>
<item>Laurent Romary wants an annotation block—for specific linguistics use cases.</item>
<item>Council looks at <gi>annotationBlock</gi> proposal, and its unusual (possibly abusive?) use of <gi>span</gi> for indicating the body portion of an annotation, only because of its use of pointing attributes (avoiding what the element is supposed to do). RV: perhaps we can expand the model of <gi>span</gi>?</item>
<item>The discussion on <gi>annotationBlock</gi> and nontextual might take a while.</item>
<item>But we can work with the simpler <gi>annotation</gi> as a working proposal.</item>
<item>RV: asks about whether we’re implementing the “motivation” for making an <gi>annotation</gi> (a part of w3c annotation model). HC: also, who made the <gi>annotation</gi> (@resp). What are the TEI correspondences to these aspects of the w3c model?</item>

<item>Original discussion during February meeting: improve tests to prevent problems during release (see <ref target="https://tei-c.org/activities/council/meetings/tei-technical-council-teleconference-2019-02-18/">February minutes</ref>)</item>
<item>Simple Print: We need better exemplar testing</item>
<item>Maybe it will be easier to add tests when MH works on his test suite?</item>
<item>JC: Can we do different levels of testing? Not just testing each checked-in change, but more rigorous testing before a release? Just testing by diffing expected results is … fragile to say the least.</item>
<item>SB: Test2 directory in Stylesheets dev branch does speedier testing, but doesn’t do everything in Test1 yet.</item>
<item>MS: What about co-dependency loop of Stylesheets — Guidelines. Build process for the one is missing something needed in the other. How do PS and MH make this work?
<list style="ul">
<item>JC: Should we have a folder in TEI that holds the latest stable Stylesheets version that we use for the release? This way we don’t rely on the current Stylesheets for a release.</item>
<item>PS: We can run the build with different Stylesheets versions. master built with master, and dev with dev.</item>
<item>SB: Why were the repos separated in the first place? JC: Perhaps because there are things in Stylesheets that aren’t directly TEI related.</item>
<item>PS: Not clear what our dependencies are. We should sort that out very clearly; putting a directory of Stylesheets in TEI repo is making this more complicated.</item>
<item>ODD processing is needed for other things than TEI, even though written in TEI ODD language.</item>
<item>JC: We have saxon and ant, etc. in TEI-c repo lib. TEI Guidelines should be a consumer of the TEI Stylesheets in some similar way (using a stable version) … PS: We have several versions of jing floating around and it’s hard to know where to find the right ones. It would better to have a defined way to bring these in.</item>
<item>PS: Run Guidelines build with Stylesheets master. Should be releasing Stylesheets more frequently</item>
<item>HC/MS: Reason to release Stylesheets after Guidelines(!): you need to edit expected results of tests following the latest updates to the Guidelines. New Guidelines release can break the Stylesheets just because of breaking the tests.</item>
<item>Stylesheets tests breaking is a guarantee.

</item>
<item>Stylesheets work: best always to work in a branch and keep it updated; only check it into dev branch when it passes local tests. Make sure dev is always building without fail.
