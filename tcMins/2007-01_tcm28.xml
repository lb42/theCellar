          <item>SB reminded Council that this had been determined to
            be a false action immediately after the last call. LB
            reminded Council that SB had proposed two possible paths forward

            for encoding the relationship of one bibliographic item to

          <item>DO reported his findings, explaining that the Board

          <label>DP &amp; CT: make ODD of it</label>
          <item>CT reports he is almost done coding an ODD; he has run
            into a hitch redefining classes, hopes to have it
            straightened out soon, but may need the help of an ODD
            expert. This ODD is based on the ideas put forth in the
            <ref target="http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/2006/001993.html"><title>facsimile 
                markup</title></ref> post mentioned above. There was
            general agreement that if new TEI elements are introduced
            they should probably go into chapter
            FT-TablesFormulaeGraphics.

          <p>Council reluctantly concluded that, realistically, it will
            probably be necessary to defer inclusion of a detailed
            discussion of physical bibliography to a future
            sub-release of P5 (e.g., to P5 1.1).</p>

	  <p>It was reported that MD is organizing a two-headed
	    meeting in Vilnius in late February, consisting of a 2-day
	    discussion on place name issues and any other outstanding
	    personography hosted by the Institute for Lithuanian
	    Language of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, and a
	    1-day TEI outreach event at and co-hosted by Vilnius
	    University.</p>

          <p>As sufficient funds were available, SR has added Italian
          to the list of languages being worked on. By the summer we
          will need to think about how this stuff will be made
          available in the P5 release, i.e.  what the user interface
          and the look-and-feel will be in the online Guidelines. </p>

        <head>Road to P5</head>
        <p>The discussion revolved around the possible use of
        task-tracking software and the need for a <soCalled>prodding
        czar</soCalled> to remind people of ongoing tasks to help keep
        us on schedule. It was pointed out that project management or
        task-tracking software is really just a tool in the prodding
        czar's arsenal. LB suggested that the main problem is a lack of
        resources, not lack of planning. Other said that more
        structured planning can make better use of scarce
        resources. CW suggested TCW08, EDW81 and a couple of other
        lists should be placed on a Wiki. After a lengthy discussion,
        it was decided to create a planning subcommittee, initially
        consisting of DO, CW, and SR. Their first action is to create
        a list of things which had to be achieved to reach P5 by a
        notional date of October 1st, along with their necessary dates
        of completion. When agreed, the same group would be tasked to
	ensure the tasks were implemented. The list should use previous efforts &amp;
        lists as a starting point.<note type="action"> <label>planning
